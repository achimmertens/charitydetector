Ich warte noch auf ein paar Rückmeldungen. \nIch werde @seunruth und ihre kranke Mutter unterstützen. Mit etwas Glück kann ich sogar eine lokale Organisation auftun, die besser helfen kann. Wir werden sehen. \n\nWas sich sonst noch rund um @hive.helps getan hat, erfahrt ihr in diesem Artikel. \n\n@hive.helps hat jetzt auch einen **<a href=\"https://hive.vote/dash.php?i=1&trail=hive.helps\">curation trail</a>**. Wenn ihr eure HP passiv für etwas gutes nutzen wollt, könnt ihr diesem folgen. \n</div>\n\n<div class=\"pull-right\">\n\n# A quiet month\nAfter the large deposit in May, June was rather quiet. \n\nThe donation for June will follow later this week. I'm still waiting for some feedback. \nI will support @seunruth and her sick mother. With a bit of luck, I may even be able to find a local organization that can help better. We will see. \n\nYou can find out what else has happened with @hive.helps in this article. \n\n@hive.helps now also has a **<a href=\"https://hive.vote/dash.php?i=1&trail=hive.helps\">curation trail</a>**. If you want to use your HP passively for something good, you can follow it. \n\n\n</div>\n\n___\n\n<div class=\"pull-left\">\n\n# HBD Entwicklung\nDas Ziel von @hive.helps ist es, in den nächsten Jahren 15.000 HBD anzusparen, um mit den Zinsen dauerhaft Spenden zu finanzieren. \n\nBis dieses Ziel erreicht ist, werden sämtliche Zinsen und Rewards im Account belassen. Die Spenden zahlt @kheldar1982 bis dahin weiterhin ohne etwas aus dem Account zu entnehmen. \n\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"pull-right\">\n\n# HBD development\nThe goal of @hive.helps is to save up 15,000 HBD over the next few years in order to use the interest to permanently finance donations. \n\nUntil this goal is reached, all interest and rewards will be left in the account. Until then, @kheldar1982 will continue to pay the donations without taking anything from the account. \n\n</div>\n\n___\n\n|Topic|Amount|\n|-|-|\n|Balance 15.05.24|3,717 HBD|\n|Deposits|45 HBD|\n|Interests|67 HBD|\n|Rewards|17 HBD|\n|Balance 23.06.24|3,846 HBD|\n\n\n___\n\n<div class=\"pull-left\">\n\n### Top Spender\nDie folgende Liste zeigt alle HBD unserer großzügigen Spender:\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"pull-right\">\n\n### Donor Overview\nThe following list shows all our generous HBD donators:\n</div>\n\n___\n\n|Donor|Amount|\n|-|-|\n|@kheldar1982|3,124 HBD|\n|@condeas|182 HBD|\n|@danielhuhservice|162 HBD|\n|@germansailor|100 HBD|\n|@jedigeis|34 HBD|\n|@fredfettmeister|5 HBD|\n|@edina76|8 HBD|\n|@siphon|5 HBD|\n|@hafiz34|7 HBD|\n|@louis88|2 HBD|\n\n\n___\n\n<div class=\"pull-left\">\n\nDer größte Treiber für das Wachstum der HBD Rewards waren im Juni die Zinsen.

Aber auch @hafiz34 bleibt uns treu. \n\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"pull-right\">\n\nThe biggest driver of HBD Rewards growth in June was interest.

      "body": "I was just celebrating the fact that there hadn't been any drop offs at the temple in quite some time but now we have had exactly that happen.  I understand that puppies can be a lot of work, especially when you end up with 4 of them at the same time but there is an easy solution to all of this to prevent the need to abandon your dog and her puppies - you can get the mother sterilized like a responsible pet owner.  That's right, the owner abandoned the mum as well as the pups and I guess I can say that I kind of appreciate that so that the pups have a mother to look after them at least.\n\n<center> \n![image.png](https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmPbnHjDsNC6nWb13AEAUfHTjCpStMrFUnzcUdrw4CGnim/image.png)\n</center>\n\nMaybe I'm just a big softy, but I just can't imagine looking at these two and deciding to toss them out of the car at a temple and just hope for the best.   Thankfully, the mom is with them so we don't have to hope for a surrogate, and we are creating a little hiding place for her and hope the other dogs in the temple will kind of leave her alone.   Normally dogs are pretty good at leaving well enough alone but when it comes to being territorial dogs don't really care if you are big or small, young or old.   Either they accept you, or they don't.  \n\n<center>  \n![image.png](https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmdyqzWuw6nFKGi7gaevSrREkHan1PX8qt5vqwEwukJ8p7/image.png)\n</center>\n\nThere's just something magical about puppies.   I know they can be a lot of work but that is why you control your own dog's ability to have them.   It isn't cruel to sterilize your dog.  They wont even know what has happened and their life will be better because of it.   \n\n<center> \n![image.png](https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmQUELXs5abmMfKnXpLVVEoomqPxf8vBwX28LkTogVWeS9/image.png)\n</center>\n\nWe were alerted immediately to the presence of these new dogs at one of Krabi's smaller temples and we went out to see what the deal was.  Thankfully all of the dogs including the mother are in relatively good health and Mom was very approachable which suggests to me that she is very used to interacting with humans.   \n\n<center> \n![image.png](https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmeiKgjPUU6DeoRFVi2MFnoAsWYaHuayWVcVjnNKRtEYC5/image.png)\n</center>\n\nWe still gave her a bunch of treats to try to get into her good graces.  \n\n<center> \n![image.png](https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmSDvqnuRiEwX6mJgu78eRSgXQmRgVTtSVLks2PavkvoU5/image.png)\n</center>\n\nThe plan now is to wait about a week and then we will bring both mom and her female pup into the veterinarian to have them sterilized, then we will continue to feed them as well.  We have already put a notice out there that all of these are available for adoption as a unit, because we will not separate mothers from their pups until the young ones grow up a bit.   It is better this way, trust me.  \n\n<hr> \n\nif you would like to see how you can help out or simply spread the word, please visit our website at\n\n<h3> http://krabianimalwelfare.org </h3>\n\n<center> ![21462758_174743779763179_4154543215066704521_n.jpg](https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmXHEhXj4e6AzsbAJKsFo8csozuoq1uUcMSdFQTYifzi55/21462758_174743779763179_4154543215066704521_n.jpg) </center> \n\n<center> <sub> Krabi Animal Welfare is a charity run entirely by volunteers and are a registered non-profit organization in Thailand and the U.K..

Організатори Свята музики говорять, що запрошено на подію гурти «Пиріг і Батіг», NAZVA, Мертвий Півень, «Мія Рамарі», INSO-Lviv тощо.\nОсобливістю Свята музики у Львові є те, що музиканти можуть реєструватися заздалегідь або виконувати музику спонтанно. Слухачі ж гуляють містом, слухаючи різноманітні виступ,и або ж залишаються в клубі чи кав’ярні, знайшовши свою музику.\nЗапочатковане свято у Франції ще у далекому 1982 році. Його назва французькою – «Fete de la Musique»: гра слів, співзвучна з гаслом «Робіть музику!». За тридцять років існування Свято музики охопило всю земну кулю: від Парижа до Буенос-Айреса, від Бостона до Калькутти, від Мельбурна до Бейруту. Разом з усім світом насолоджується музикою і Львів.\nМета свята – наблизити музику до людей, тому всі концерти безкоштовні. Слід також зазначити, що цьогоріч фестиваль буде благодійним. Організатори спільно з фондом Musicians Defend Ukraine збиратимуть 250 тис. грн на 12 FPV дронів. \n\n![1.jpg](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/radiogaga/23wMuaRUeCN4on1FuSKURcxxuSo9YDrTUexULgfCs9GetchEktYdJSJ4BF6oVrqM7mLLk.jpg)\n[джерело](https://24tv.ua/svyato-muziki-lvovi-2024-yaki-gurti-vistupatimut-programa-dnya_n2579925)\n\n![2.jpg](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/radiogaga/23zRxjGV91EwRy8zTmhJDEvicKJi2EmLn7BL6jQykophZvs2HkTob5jCzzGXa7mCmyTEw.jpg)\n[фото ЛМР](https://tvoemisto.tv/news/u_lvovi_znovu_vidbudetsya_svyato_muzyky_programa_165377.html)\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNyKjhEJaXI",

      "body": "Hello great friends in @hive reach-out community. We are gradually growing and we believe that in the next six months things would have changed in this community. \nhttps://img.inleo.io/DQmW3Vzr8JfhwgWkhxVUeLBPKKEttrYxcGkxXaVahj17ZGR/IMG_20221125_100906_320.jpg\n\nFor this week I think I want to do something very special. Something that has been of help to me and I feel it can help someone who might need it.\n\nIn life there are things we need to understand. I have seen things work differently from what we design and some times is because of poor planning or follow up.  Why did I say that?  I have discovered that people prefer to receive than to give. There is more blessings in given than just receiving. \n\n\nIn all my life as a woman I discovered from the Holy book that a giver is sowing a seed but a receiver is eaten up the harvest. Harvest and seed for sowing which is bigger? From the eyes of man, we know that harvest is more in number than the seed to be planted most times. But for how long can the harvest last? It might just be within one or two months and we will begin to buy food from the market. Maybe also depending on the quantity of the harvest. But no matter what the quantity is, it will soon vanish from your sight. \n\n https://img.inleo.io/DQmVQd2KYnhRJnGCSgjNm2CJKQrymSNvVj4JSWVtBTygWmQ/IMG_20221125_100257_900.jpg \nThe seed on the other hand May just be a bad of 🌽 corn. What will be the amount of maize that will be harvested at the end? If the farmer took proper care of the farm during the farming season, then he may end up getting up to one trailer full of maize. Counting it in bags may give us up to hundred bags of maize. You see the huge difference? \n\nWe need to learn to give than just receiving. If all we do is who will help me? How can I make see someone who will dash me this or that? We need to start thinking of who to help with our little substances that we have. Remember the widow that came to the prophet in the Holy book asking for help because her husband died and his debtors have come to carry her children away. The prophet told her to go and make use of that little oil that she have to solve all her problems and still, she will still have left over. That is exactly what happened. She was made to know that the little oil that she thought was not good for anything can really save her family and even the future. This is a great lesson for me. Give and receive not. \n\nWhen we give, we are sowing the little that we have and it will come back in hundred folds. This is the promise of God to givers. \n\nThe more you give, the more you receive. Givers never lack and I have confirmed it in my life. Each time I give to the needed in the society, God always bring something very special that I have been expecting to me. He will not allow us beg when we have taken time to give what we have to others.\n\nLastly, the little that we have will still remain little if we don't share it with others in love. \n\nAll the images used in this post belongs to me.\n \n\nPosted Using [InLeo Alpha](https://inleo.io/@adaezeinchrist/blessed-is-the-hand-that-give-than-the-hand-that-receive-2ib)",
