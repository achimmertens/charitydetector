Should you go on an adventure without a drink, all you would find is space and the knowledge that you did not have any purpose. Sacred locations unquestionably provide tired hearts solace and lessons in humility and help us grow spiritually. Charity—selfless, giving of one's time, money, and resources to assist those in need—is among the most commendable qualities for conquering adversity. Giving enables one to feel as if others share their issues. Encouragement of compassion and happiness for others boosts both.\n\n<br>\n<center>\n![1.png](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/lucidlucrecia/23yx6EQywZKjkcGJv14YWRaZVCrsY9upYsK87LTwSVaoVKtDCK6s8qjJMhVpHCmRHqWhJ.png)[Source: Canva Pro](canva.com)</center>\n\n\nMaintaining purity cannot be achieved with the help of charity from atheists or those seeking sensual pleasure. Among these good deeds are the most moral reactions to evil and clinging: care, land gift, product charity, cow charity, maiden charity, afterlife limb or leg giving, education, charity for calm, and food charity. Educating a poor person is a long-term gift as it eradicates ignorance. One must show others their understanding and richness if they want to appreciate and profit from God's blessings. Like hidden jewels, education, and learning are gifts that one may make in secret as they are not readily stolen and still have value even in terrible times financially. A person with a decent education does not lack moral qualities and does not disrupt the peace of others. Some individuals like to give anonymously as they believe their left hand does not deserve to know what their right hand produces.\n\n<br>\n\n\n<center>![2.png](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/lucidlucrecia/23vsEFFTMv7bx7uZjC7cA7SzAMBs1TUTrAFMn3bS4L5JD1L2ZbxXkMaQ97MS9vDs5JZra.jpg)[Source: Canva Pro](canva.com)</center>\n\n<br>\n\n\nThe best deed one can do for humanity is to donate blood to save a life. The donors of eggs and sperm might enable the infertile couple to start a fresh life for the unhappy and damaged individuals in their vicinity. Even people who are devoid of anything good may find something to do with their time for the advantage of the underprivileged. We have to develop the charity of love that our parents, saints, and erudites ingrained in us by feeding us with love to stop the marginalization of individuals based on their color, religion, socioeconomic level, or lack of resources. Besides that, it benefits their emotional state. Charity, therefore, is just providing for people in need. The act is magnificent; the giver is in paradise on Earth.\n\nLike nondiscriminatory rivers, mountains, forests, and seas all sharing and augmenting their ownership, so must we. Giving to charity is a gamble not worth measuring in terms of monetary or in-kind value. The road also gets us where we want to go without asking anything in return. However, we retain our comforts and belongings to ourselves, even if we let others in on our grief. God is the always present \"Giver,\" bestowing His gifts and magical works on our belongings. His reward pool runs entirely. He even looks after the tiniest of creatures. Giving to charity helps us solve many of life's problems and remove our fixation with accumulating unneeded money. Likewise removed is the temptation of undesirable goals and aspirations.\n\n<br>\n\n<center>\n![3.png](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/lucidlucrecia/23xL2wUobjTffXLXWxCp6ck4u6GesYbWDA9v5FLMAA3yKuNKKA9NGCFYR1D5Np6Qkd9Ci.jpg)[Source: Canva Pro](canva.com)</center>\n\n<br>\n\nLife is an offering; you must learn to align with the natural surroundings. Therefore, give generously. You will have to accept loss at last. Spiritual progress comes from a supplying viewpoint; a needed attitude causes a significant setback. Giving to charity, some believe, makes the giver's money holy. One may reach spiritual enlightenment and atonement in this manner. Before His arch-devote, God also takes in numerous forms, including food for the hungry and assistance for the weak and impotent.\n\n\n\n\nThe actual intent of showpieces donated by charities becomes clear. Their hands become pure from the kindness and care offered to them. His grace helps whatever we provide to evil to return to the Lord. Those who are sickly, ailing, illiterate, bereaved, humiliated, and weak are receiving these heavenly blessings. The blessings and joys of the Lord will be lost if the receiver is too reliant and never seeks to stand on their own two feet.\n\nThe prime minister of Chandra Gupta Maurya, Acharya Chanakya, a renowned mediator and author of Artha Shastra, had rightly advised us to stay within our means when making donations so that our stocks would run low and we would only be worried.\n\n<br>\n\n<center>\n![4.png](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/lucidlucrecia/AKcfzVgfcFoU1YYzjSWTzFUievkM2Fi4Uhnb44HzwtRzCDuJRJSepN5Mv6v1L9z.jpg)[Source: Canva Pro](canva.com)</center>\n\n\nOne sure strategy to increase your health and lengthen your life span is to donate to charity without expecting anything in return. These people remain free from hypertension, cardiovascular disease, etc., and get peace of mind because of God's poise, the natural advantages of the beneficiaries, and their changed positive attitude toward life. The provider also finds gratification. Such a provider always performs good actions; his benefits are never exhausted as the Supreme Lord mysteriously restarts them. Moreover, we should donate as freely as a lightbulb does for its purpose of eradicating darkness by lighting formerly unoccupied spaces. Charity strengthens the more we use it, like honing, maintaining, and reproducing intellect. One kind of self-filtering punishment is charitable donation. One follows this road to discover God.\n\n\n \n\nPosted Using [InLeo Alpha](https://inleo.io/@lucidlucrecia/the-power-of-giving-98p)",

It is for this reason that the NGO I worked with made me their project manager for all Charity cases. \n\nTwo years ago, I was given a case file to attend to. I had studied the case file and was asked to go and confirm the story.\n\nAccording to the case file, the lady is a widow with two teenage children. She's just recovering from stroke and currently homeless as she could not pay up her rent given her health condition and money spent for her to attain full recovery.\n\nI called the lady and introduced myself, we spoke briefly on the phone and I collected her details, then told her I would be coming around. \n\nThe day I was going to her place, it felt like I was entering into a hole as the motorcycle kept driving, and no building was in sight. It was almost at the end of the road we saw a small settlement and according to her description that's where she will be waiting for me. \n\nI got down from the motorcycle and gave her a call, while the phone rang, I was on the lookout for her. We eventually met, and then she took me to where she lived. It was underneath the staircase of an uncompleted building. They barely had good clothes to wear nor a bed to sleep on. According to her, her previous landlord has seized her belongings over failure to meet with her rent. \n\nThe uncompleted building that she was living in was courtesy of her pastor.\n\nI looked at this woman and her children, most, especially her teenage daughter, and my heart sank because I could almost feel their pain and discomfort.\n\nI did not take any pictures of them because I would rather not make the situation more awkward by making them feel more uncomfortable than they are already feeling. Besides, it's a simple case where we would not be needing crowdfunding, so their identity do not need to be revealed. \n\nAfter seeing their condition and discussing briefly with her, I asked her, so what do you want us (the NGO) to do for you? And she said that she wanted us to clear her rent so she could go back to her apartment. \n\nI looked at this lady again and smiled. I asked her what she's currently doing for a living, and she said she sells like some sort of petty trade which was what I had seen at her veranda when I went to her place, few biscuits, groundnuts and 2 crate of soft drinks.\n\nNot only that, but I asked her how she hoped to renew her rent, and then she said that she's hoping on God to bring something tangible for her before the rent expires.\n\nLikewise, I asked this lady about her children's education, and she said that's the least of her problem, that she just wanted them to survive the hard times first.\n\nFurthermore, I took a deep breath, and then I started counselling her because clearly she's about to make a mistake. \n\nBeing a mother and also career plus business oriented, I know how draining it is balancing work (business) life and motherhood. \n\nI told her she will not be able to leave her current situation for a better one if her children tag along. If she insists on holding on to her children, all of them will suffer, and clearly she doesn't have the capacity to even provide them the necessities. \n\nI suggested to her why don't the NGO take temporary custody of her children, provide them with life's basic and a conducive environment while she goes on to improve on her life. I assured her that the moment she becomes financially Ok, she can have her children back.\n\n\n![](https://images.ecency.com/DQmWVCsuqfNX5GDfucBTmZbmu6sR2gKUCJTHcmgGczGw9sE/1723313042750.jpg)\n\n\nShe was skeptical then I gave her our Orphanage address and asked her to pay a visit. I showed her some pictures and she was wowed! \n\nAt the end of our discussion she saw reasons with me and I promised her that I will see to it that the NGO gives her capital to expand her business since she said that is what she wants to start with.\n\nI got back home and filed my report, scanned and sent a soft copy to the NGO director. He read through and supported my suggestions and then bought my remarks. \n\nThe woman did come to our Homeless shelter and even spent a night there. She saw the children there are immediately agreed to letting us take temporary custody. \n\nAlthough we had some hiccups with the women affairs commission as they insisted the children should be adopted permanently to parents who can fend for them.\n\nI oversaw the case and I fought it out with them. They refused to give us authorization to adopt the children so we went straight to the court. After the woman explained her plight, she was taken straight to the magistrate who, after listening to her story, endorsed the adoption papers.\n\nThe children went on to live under our custody for five years after which the lady was granted back custody through the court, having ascertained that she was now doing better financially than she was.\n\n",

Love seems to play a great impact on who chooses to love in terms of growth and happiness and live peacefully. Hopefully there is a special reward behind love, happiness depends on who is choosing to love.\n \n**Considering the pain one has to go through, I can tell that love is not an easy task. Love can be seen smooth when they people involved in the relationship have the ability to understand each other than then the feeling moved smoothly, it may not be easy enough to understand one another but outlining the purpose of love and the principal surrounding it sure we can easily get to the direction we are heading to where we wishes.\n\n\n\n\n![](https://images.ecency.com/DQmPC4t1GTgmjm8Hvasu3YpwnU8S3Ne2t4rKFEXn6X1Bsjs/29aa9306_9b5d_4a32_940c_779c856af3a8.jpg)\n\n**Love is a beautiful thing everyone wishes to go in although it may not seem perfect full with a lot of mistaking but the funny part of it is that you can not chooses to love then you didn't get hurt is better we acknowledge it right for the beginning and understand that a something might in the relationship we are going in. \n\n**Deciding to love you must be ready to sacrifice because this is the point where one is able to say I will really cherish you and I will prove the percentage of love you have for the person.\n\n**Sacrifice is the greatest prove of love and this stand as an highest point view in relationship, sacrifice is considered as the biggest thing that is entrust in relationship and this is the main key points one must have in mind before going into relationship \nThen other things like tolerance , respect can now be demanded. \n\n**I thought of these things before I considered relationship that the major rules that are necessary for love, I understand that love hurt and can be face with challenge that can give room for betrayer may also lead to heartbreak  but all was considered my me before I decide to have someone I can call a friend for the sake of love a lot of sacrifice as be made by me but my happiness is that the sacrifice I have  made by me is to the person who's also love me and also ready to sacrifice too, the energy we put into love is what we're enjoying today so they is every reason to love .",

They go out their way to make their loved ones happy and cared for.\nLove inspired people to be their best selves and to make meaningful gesture to show their affection. It's all about making each other feel special and cherished.\nLove can be characterized in different aspects which are: Sacrifice, commitment, loyalty, patience, kindness and many more.\nThere are many ways or things one may decide to prove love and there are alot of things one can do for love\n\nBiblically, we are shown  how Christ professed his love to mankind, and saw how he sent his only begotten son to come and die for us, he had no other child, he had no other son, but he gave the only one he has to come and die for our sins. This is what God has done for love and it is seen as the greatest way of showing love.\n\n![pexels-pixabay-208216.jpg](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/iamgracia/Eo8SH4LwGdeMekVrFqGEPaubh6ANiYCQok1sbtU3vULUyYb77Dy62wf8Gqpa4MKUgja.jpg)<sub><a href=''>*https://www.pexels.com/photo/crucifix-illustration-208216/*</a></sub>\n\n\nWhen you love someone, you must learn to sacrifice just as our father did, love without sacrifice is not love.\nSo to me, another way of defining love is sacrifice, cause you cannot live without giving.\nSacrifice is a natural part of love that has to do with prioritizing the needs of others, \nIt has to do with giving up things that are important to us to the person we love. \nSacrifice is very challenging but it brings fulfillment to our lives. \nSacrifices brings comfort, and  it builds relationships\nWhen someone sacrifice, it demonstrate ones commitment and love towards others, by making sacrifices, we show that we value our loved one's happiness and well-being above our own desires\n\n\n![pexels-vitor-correia-1346087292-25578226.jpg](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/iamgracia/23uQkFjfEYsbDnZUVyZF24pUAnZTNKyMk5i6PE2ApxXvBDpTB5UHGHkmBc4C5w2o7sWEk.jpg)<sub><a href=''>*https://www.pexels.com/photo/happy-couple-posing-together-in-park-25578226/*</a></sub>\n\nAnother important way one can prove love is by giving and showing kindness, doing these proves that one really cares and shows concern for others. Act of kindness to someone you love can be shown in different aspects such as offering words of encouragement, being there for your loved one, putting smiles on their faces, assisting in different task and many more and by doing these, it strengthens relationships/bonds between people, \nKindness may sound or look simple to people but I must say it's very powerful, cause it fills a blank space in the heart. \nListening actively to our loved ones, understanding their need and showing appreciation through words and actions can strengthen the bond of love. \nPracticing patience, kindness, and being supportive in both good and challenging times can also help us become better in giving out love, \nIt's all about present, care and thoughtful towards those we love.What is love without kindness or patience?\nIt's obviously nothing\n\n![pexels-nazila-25695914.jpg](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/iamgracia/23w2kgRT5fVtxRvQEqzuBmx7FuFAjZmcCpX4EVZKvmZJ8KjFbuyt1huJuiabXbRAsA1Q6.jpg)<sub><a href=''>*https://www.pexels.com/photo/a-family-with-a-little-boy-and-a-dog-sitting-on-the-beach-25695914/*</a></sub>\n\n\nLove improves personal growth in the sense that it makes one to embrace different challenges that comes in and it helped one to learn and grow radically.\nLove on the other hand also bring self improvement, it helps one to work on his or her flaws, weaknesses and habits to become better partners, friends, parents, and many more.\nLove help us to change to be a better partner, friend or parents.\nSo by embracing personal growth we become more supportive, understanding and loving partners, parents and friends\nLove forgives... Forgiveness is one of the most important aspect of love, cause it helps one to let go of grudges and negative emotions and it helps one understands others perspective and flaws, it releases the burden of pain, resentment and anger in the lives of people\n\nLove is a beautiful thing🤭\nTo me, I feel there is nothing one cannot do when love is involved, sometimes we see it as foolishness after doing somethings for the people we love and we start having low self esteem, but it is what it is, you cannot cheat love, \nWhen you love, you do what you can, it's when you love that you noticed you can do all things for the person you love...\nGenerally, love is nothing without sacrifice, patience, commitment and kindness.",

      "body": "Firstly, what is love? If I say love is that feeling you you have for someone \"special\".  That word SPECIAL , you might think it's meant for only your family members but , the question is who's special to you? \nTo me everyone is special but the whole thing is depending on how we understand each other. \nApart from the kind of love between husband and wife, there's this other love for kids and that for friends now that's the kind of love am talking about. \nThey're some time you might come across someone you don't even know, who's in need of help, how would you react? Firstly, you'll think like oh it's none of my business, after all you're not my relative, but then, weather relative or not he or she needs your help. Will you be a good Samaritan? \nOn several occasions people had accident before me, and I will always run to help not minding if am touching the persons blood or not, one day it happened and I rush to victim and started cleaning the blood with both my hancky and my hands. All I want is for the bleeding to stop. A man came called me and said, be careful how you touch peoples blood, it's not good. \nBut I didn't know when am doing all those things. \n\nIn my area one day, I was like oh God when will my destiny helper locate me, my spirit answered me saying, \"you are a destiny helper to somebody and you're here looking for a destiny helper \". Each time my neighbors children gets ill they'll always run to my house. They call it their clinic . My neighbors daughter once said to me, mummy igwe ( that's what's my neighbors call me). Did you know that God brought you here because of us. I freezed and remembered what my spirit told me. \nOne thing is that  the husband of this my neighbors is OK, I mean the man is financially balanced, but the family is not seeing it, they hear testimonies outside of how their father is helping people but his families are like his enemies including the wife. That word Charity begins at home is not for me o. This man will buy fish or meat and give it to the wife to cook and fry that's after counting it. And him Alone will finish the whole thing in their presence. \nOutsiders talk good of him but his goodness never reached his home. He's not even showing his wife the love, I don't want to go on and on talking about this man but I don't think that man is worth emulating from. \n\nBut the question is, what should we call the kind of love of a man that can't buy his wife drugs left alone taking her to the hospital when she's ill, but he'll pay hospital bill for outsiders. Give me your answer in the comments section below. \nLet us try and show love not only to our family members but to outsiders too or not only to outsiders but let our families enjoy our love too. Charity begins at home, let us try and balance it. \nAlways put yourself in the condition of that person and try to helping out, put on the shoe that person is wearing so you'll understand where it is paining him or her. \n\nA wise prophet once said LET LOVE LEAD, the triple \"L\", always remember that. Let us not be self-centered like one man I know, he's married, all the time he want his wife to be calling his people on phone to check on them especially his mother but he never dialed his in-laws number by mistake not to talk of sending something to them. He loves his own but hate others, it's very bad. You must not have something going on between you and someone before you show them love. \nI hope this little write up will help us know that God is love, if you love God then show love to people. It's because of God's love for you that you're still alive today, God loves us despite all our short comings. \nHope you enjoyed reading this. \nTHANKS.\n\n https://img.inleo.io/DQmPUUbDM5kZA1Z5hDoozQtGxDz6oiwhCz57tH89BLgmL3d/1719847461759.jpg \n\n\n\nPosted Using [InLeo Alpha](https://inleo.io/@jennycool/how-far-am-i-willing-to-go-for-love--7qm)",

I am currently going through 10 pallets of wood, breaking them down, sanding and planning them ready for the kids to be able to use them.\n\nCurrently lacking enough tools to make quick work of the prep work but I am hoping to remedy this at a later date.\nWith any luck I am trying to get a belt sander with the hope of cleaning up these boards a lot quicker, But funding is at zero at the moment so it's a work in progress.\n\nI have ordered the PVA glue ready for the Halloween building that the kids have asked to do in the next session.\nSo far they have requested we make some ghosts, gravestones and pumpkins. How it ends will be a bit of entertainment as I said they can paint it however they want. I'm assuming there's going to be some bright pink ghosts at this rate!\nAs always I will post what they get up to over the next few weeks. I am currently still doing the meetings on a 1 to 1 basis to see how they all are in the workshop.\n\nI want to say a big thankyou to @thisismylife for her amazing work on our new logo! It's a beautiful piece and fits the group so well.\n\nIf you are reading this post and wondering who the [Hive-Woodpeckers](https://peakd.com/hive-177682/@hive-woodpeckers/introduction-to-the-hive-woodpeckers-3cg) are, click the link and check out our introduction post.\n\nI want to say a massive thankyou to everyone who has supported us so far, from words of encouragement to upvotes. You are helping change kids lives and it is an amazing thing to be a part of.\n\nBig up to @bitcoinman who's been a great help too and also @stickupcurator for being awesome!\nPosted Using [InLeo Alpha](https://inleo.io/@hive-woodpeckers/update-on-the-hivewoodpeckers-3zd)\n\nPosted Using [InLeo Alpha](https://inleo.io/@hive-woodpeckers/update-on-the-hivewoodpeckers-3zd)",

God has made it clear in the scripture that we should love one another and be our brothers keeper. Love is an adventure that has no end and when we love, we help each other to grow and live peacefully, there's a huge reward for love and that's peace from within.\n\nLove is not an easy road because it takes two or more persons with Patience and virtue to work together in it and when something involves two different individuals walking together, we tend to have different opinions and so many dislikes and want from one another and when we understand the principles of love we definitely can ride the boat to whatever destination we wish to. The bible says and I quote \"Can two walk together, except they agree\" this is the basic principles of love for me.\n\nAgreeing to walk with each other despite the imperfections and mistakes fuels and sustain love, you can't love and don't get hurt, the earlier we understand this concept the more we won't be having broken relationship. Love is sacrifice because you must be willing to showcase the gravity of your love to whoever you claim to love. Jesus Christ is the perfect example for me. \n\n*\"God so loved the world and He gave His only begotten son Jesus Christ that whosoever believeth in Him shall not perish\"*\nJohn 3:16\n\nThis is the biggest evidence and prove of love even from our creator, that was a huge sacrifice for humanity. He loved the world and decided to sacrifice His only son to die for us on the cross of Calvary for our redemption, this is sacrifice. If we humans are ready to love then we must be ready to sacrifice or else we can't sustain a lasting relationship with one another both marriage wise and friendship wise, tolerance is one of those sacrifice, giving is one of those sacrifice, it's not enough to profess love without putting it to action.\n\nI love to love and I understand that love hurts and we can eventually be betrayed just like Jesus was too but He didn't stop loving humanity. One of the reasons we are having a world today with so many people that don't want to love again is because of heartbreaks, heartbreaks are everywhere now and so many people are on the verge of revenge thereby increasing the number of heartbreaks in the world. We need to learn from the scriptures and learn to love no matter how many times we are broken.\n\nMy kind advice is that we should love everyone but put our trust in God, we can trust each other too but we should always remember that humans can fail us but God will never. We should love but activate our right senses and be very vigilant. When we love, we are supposed to be loved back in return. It hurts to love someone and never get loved in return. It is two different thing to sacrifice for the person that loves you just like you loved them and sacrificing for someone that doesn't love you at all, that's how to get broken into many pieces. We should channel our love to the right persons.\n\nThank you \n",
