      "body": "Wow! The year is gradually coming to an end. This year won't end without you reaching the peck you have desired to reach. \nHive Reach out Community/Inleo initiative week 15, I am @johndoy0. It always amazing to find myself among great and wonderful persons. Alright, this week, we are considering a topic which says \"Knowledge verses Experience\"\nThey two have great impact in the formation of every human being. Cause by the time one of them is missing you become an incomplete personality. While because the knowledge you about a thing give an edge of million of billions who are illiterate over that thing, this is because with time you will tend to have an edge of them. It is written in the Bible \" a man's gift maketh a room for him, for he shall stand not before ordinary men but before Kings. So what then is this knowledge?\nKnowledge is a broad and multifaceted concept that refers to the awareness, understanding, and familiarity with information, facts, descriptions, or skills acquired through experience, education, or learning. It encompasses various aspects such as;\n1. Facts and information: Knowing specific details, dates, or data.\n2. Understanding: Comprehending concepts, relationships, and contexts.\n3. Wisdom: Applying knowledge to make informed decisions or judgments.\n4. Skill\nKnowledge is divided into different types such as;\n1.Declarative, Procedural, and Conditional Knowledge*\n a. Declarative Knowledge (What): Facts, concepts, and information about the world.\nExamples: Historical dates, scientific formulas, or geographical locations.\nb. Procedural Knowledge (How): Steps to perform tasks or skills.\nExamples: Riding a bike, cooking, or solving mathematical problems.\nc. Conditional Knowledge (When and Why): Understanding contexts, conditions, and consequences.\nExamples: Knowing when to apply a scientific principle or understanding the implications of a historical event.\n2. Tacit Knowledge: Intuitive, experiential, and difficult to articulate.\nExamples: Riding a bike, recognizing faces, or expertise gained through experience.\n3. Formal and Informal Knowledge\na. Formal Knowledge: Structured, systematic, and acquired through formal education or training.\na. Informal Knowledge: Unstructured, experiential, and acquired through daily life.\nExamples: Learning from family, friends, or personal experiences.\n>>Additional Categories\nPrior Knowledge:\na. Existing knowledge that serves as a foundation for new learning.\nb. Core Knowledge: Fundamental concepts and principles in a discipline or domain.\nc. Peripheral Knowledge: Secondary or supplementary information surrounding core knowledge\n Experience can be defind as:\nOxford Dictionary: \"Practical contact with or observation of facts or events, especially over a long period.\"\nMerriam-Webster Dictionary: \"Direct participation or observation; actual experience; knowledge or skill gained through involvement or exposure.\"\nCambridge Dictionary: \"The process of doing or seeing things, which gives you knowledge or skill.\"\nEncyclopedia Britannica: \"The sum of all experiences, impressions, and knowledge gained by an individual through direct participation, observation, or involvement.\"\n1. Practical knowledge or skill gained through direct participation or involvement in various activities, events, or situations over time.\n\n2. Personal encounters, observations, or experiences that shape one's perspective, understanding, or character.\n\n3. The process of learning, growing, or developing through exposure to diverse situations, challenges, or environments.\n\nIn essence, experience encompasses the accumulation of knowledge, wisdom, and expertise acquired through hands-on involvement and active engagement in various aspects of life.\n\nKey aspects of Experience:\n1. Practical involvement\n2. Direct participation or observation\n3. Knowledge or skill gained\n4. Personal encounters or events\n5. Accumulation over time\n https://img.inleo.io/DQmUZqzFcmkGS2GyvBDi2ZpQLwvJEjoYyvGGWcp2aVkc3Sh/Screenshot_20241007-012515.png \n\nExperience can be categorized into:\n\n1. Professional experience (work-related)\n2. Personal experience (life events, relationships)\n3. Social experience (interactions, cultural exposure)\n4. Educational experience (learning, training)\n\nKnowledge and experience are related but distinct in some ways such as:\nKnowledge:\n1. Theoretical understanding or information gained through study, education, or instruction.\n2. Familiarity with facts, principles, or concepts.\n3. Acquisition of information through reading, learning, or instruction.\n\nExperience:\n1. Practical application or implementation of knowledge in real-world situations.\n2. Direct participation, observation, or involvement in events or activities.\n3. Skill or expertise developed through repeated exposure or hands-on involvement.\n\nKey differences:\n1. Theory vs. Practice: Knowledge focuses on theoretical understanding, while experience emphasizes practical application.\n2. Acquisition: Knowledge is often acquired through learning, while experience is gained through direct involvement.\n3. Context: Knowledge provides general understanding, whereas experience provides specific, contextual insight.\n4. Depth: Knowledge can be superficial, whereas experience adds depth and nuance to understanding.\n5. Transferability: Knowledge can be transferred through instruction, whereas experience is often non-transferable.\n\nIllustration:\n\n- Knowledge: Understanding the principles of driving (e.g., traffic laws, vehicle mechanics).\n- Experience: Actually driving a vehicle, navigating various road conditions, and adapting to unexpected situations.\n\nRelationship Between Knowledge and Experience\nKnowledge provides the foundation for experience, and experience refines and deepens knowledge.\n\nPosted Using [InLeo Alpha](https://inleo.io/@johndoy0/hive-reach-out-inleo-initiative-15-knowledge-verses-experience-7jx)",

      "body": "Hello, 👋 \n\nLife generally requires knowledge. We need it for proper application. I'm going to share my experience in my place of work here. \n\nWe were not born to gain knowledge by default, meaning no man was born with innate knowledge about the world. Instead, knowledge is learned and acquired through effortless reading, social interaction, education, and skills. Knowledge is a powerful weapon that we should continuously seek, and this knowledge will be more effective when we actively engage in activities.\n\n\n![Screenshot_20240819-163445~2.jpg](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/dearemem/23wWyPeFbqS1AR9t7Rq3MJKUjBhB7ajdf2JcmrH3THKJTPHq9gfXz9fsAGC8X7JP2DFwM.jpg)\n_Image by me_\n\nWhen I went into the sewing business, I didn't just enter or sit on the sewing machine and start sewing. I went through the learning process by being taught first; the knowledge of sewing was given to me as a foundation to solidify my hands-on activities.\n\n\n\nYou know, how it is been done, for those of you that are apprentices, your boss needs to talk about something, calling things names and explaining. When I was an apprentice, I didn't start with cutting materials. They showed me by teaching me. After some time, unused materials were given to me to learn how to measure and cut. I stayed in measuring for months using chalk to mark on the material for cutting. This is when experience comes in after the theory part. Remember, learning or acquiring knowledge is a process; we need to follow the steps to get it well.\n\n\n\n![Screenshot_20240828-210357.jpg](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/dearemem/23wCNfwFivXxkAh3mcGbraxmFxJupCqM4hJ345sdPE1gSCnNSyYiu8gfMNuU17WJyja4a.jpg)\n_Image by me_\n\nAfter I had gotten acquainted with measuring and cutting, I now moved to the sewing machine for sewing properly; I learned this part till I got what I wanted, and my boss applauded me. From there, I now start gaining mastery in learning. At this level, I used to spoil people's clothes. Then, I was staying with my uncle as an apprentice. So he gave me his material to sew for him. I tell you the truth that I sewed nonsense. My uncle saw the nonsense in the mirror, 😂 he called me names. I cried out. I felt so bad. I'm laughing now because I have passed that level. I am a professional. I can sew any kind of style with ease and excitement.\n\nSo experience comes with failure, especially in sewing work and other works. Specifically, when you are practicing, you will be falling and rising. Many apprentices do cry before getting the right thing to be done. \n\nExperience is a great teacher; it opens doors for greater insight and engagement. Had it been, I went to obtain the knowledge only without activities to prove what I learned, I would have done how to sew fine clothes today. I will be so ashamed of myself. I can now fly to the anyway with my skills and still maintain my status quo. \n\nRight now, I'm excited for myself to stoop down to learn and experience. The experience is the sweetest part of it.\n\n\n![Screenshot_20240822-144127.jpg](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/dearemem/23xpF1VGQboDBNoHTMrbDKYqc1PNaPHVftFBwQp7KpZGxzwEX5mktdENsbF4k2rm557LU.jpg)\n_My image_\n\nTherefore, knowledge and experience serve as tools for success, growth, and personal development. Without these tools, our lives would be meaningless, and our skills would not be meaningful.\n\nIncorporating these two will take us a long way and we make our world a better place to dwell.\n\nThank you, #Hivereachout community, for this topic.\n\nYour fashionista,\n@dearemem.\n\n\n \n\n\n\nPosted Using [InLeo Alpha](https://inleo.io/@dearemem/knowledge-vs-experience-tools-for-success-growth-and-personal-development--gkc)",

      "body": "\nHello everyone Good evening and welcome to my blogs, am excited to participate in this weekly prompt for this week and sm here to share my thought \n\nKnowledge and experience are both important  in making informed decisions, but they have their different purpose in serving.\n\n\n![](https://images.ecency.com/DQmbjd33iXUZp29TvztLMDVhk3Z3MohWgPNftCMc4DgtXMV/1727985181009.jpg)[source](https://pixabay.com/photos/adult-diary-journal-notebook-book-1850177/)\n\n\nKnowledge refers to the understanding of a subject, often gained through education, reading, and research. It provides a foundation of facts, concepts, and principles that can inform decision-making.\n\nExperience on the other hand, is practical knowledge gained through personal involvement and real-world situations. It allows individuals to understand details, recognize patterns, and plan  complexities that theory alone may not cover.\n\n\n\nGuidelines and Best Practices It helps in identifying strategies that have worked in the past\nKnowledge helps to enable individuals to analyze information and predict outcomes based on data.\n\n\nExperience often cultivates a sense of insight, allowing for quicker and sometimes more accurate judgments experience helps in adapting strategies as needed.\n Experience teaches valuable lessons that theoretical knowledge may overlook.\n\n\nIn decision-making, combining knowledge and experience often leads to the best outcomes. Knowledge can guide the first approach, while experience can help refine decisions based on context and situational dynamics. \n\nConclusion:\nUltimately, effective decision-making relies on a blend of both. Knowledge can inform you of the best practices, while experience can provide insights that may not be evident in theory, allowing for a more comprehensive and practical approach\n",

      "body": "Hello, everyone!\n\nWelcome to another contest of the week. This topic is very interesting, and it will help a lot of people to get to know what to do in the theoretical and practical aspects of their field or discipline, either in school or at their place of work. After obtaining the required knowledge, it's important to go through experience practically for a better understanding that will give you the grounds for confidence and boldness.\n\n\n\n![](https://images.ecency.com/DQmXmckZStz9mR9qjCaCRE8qziqj6aJueeyZYUVk437egLk/1727881696614.png)\n\n[Source](https://pixabay.com/illustrations/woman-ladder-idea-clouds-7780330/)\n\nSo, seeing knowledge vs experience both have something to do together that comes with a comparative analysis of its nature. \n\n_Knowledge_ is the theoretical concepts that are obtained through learning in educational walls, reading, asking questions, and instructions of any kind. Knowledge could be involved in gathering facts, information, and ideas on a particular thing. \n\n ****\n While\n\n****\n\n\n_Experience_ is the application of knowledge in real-life situations that directly involve hands-on tasks and activities that require failure and success that would lead to experience. When you are practically engaged in activities, it might lead you to failure, but it will give you more experience that breeds success.\n\nKnowledge vs Experience is related to bringing results in someone's life. Knowledge serves as a foundation or pathway for gaining experience that gives ground for confidence. \n\n\n\n![](https://images.ecency.com/DQmV1syKmU21LRXicpciBJ9M1H8dkoLhRBfwXikFCAoVWjz/1727882358826.jpg)\n\n\n[Source](https://pixabay.com/photos/woman-man-kitchen-food-preparation-1979272/)\n\nTake, for instance, I am a student in one of the universities studying Hoeconomicsmics education. All my lecturers come to the lecture room every day to teach us theoretical knowledge of Home economics and obtain the oral information being taught by my lecturer. Now I have obtained the necessary knowledge I needed; it is left for me to go back home and do practicals to the experience of understanding. This knowledge and experience will help me to teach my students with confidence and boldly because of the foundation that was laid in my acquired knowledge and experience. \n\n\nMany things being taught in schools do not have hands-on activities. They are only based on theory, which does not apply to real-life situations. Nothing to show that this thing is being done that way. Students only take the chance to consume facts without practice. Some students will study courses and graduate without experience to show society what they have experienced. And some of these students will end up not being bold or confident with what they learned. \n\n\n![](https://images.ecency.com/DQmRVeF94arZ4RU48pyRFTj2TKxW6YcVMC7vDsSSFsRLQVG/1727882014692.jpg)\n\n\n[Source](https://pixabay.com/photos/surgery-hospital-doctor-care-1822458/)\n\nLet me use another field of study. Medical field where student doctors and nurses are trained to become medical experts. We all know that they deal with human life. And they need both knowledge and experience to help them become the experts they need for the sake of human life. Normally, they will learn the basic knowledge, and the practical one would be done in the bodies of dead animals before using human corpses. When they are vested with the experience they can mount the hospitals with boldness and confidence in conducting human bodies by open surgery and minimally invasive surgery by student surgeons who are now grounded with the knowledge and experience.\n\nKnowledge leads to experience and both work as a foundation for gaining confidence and boldness. Knowledge is power and experience is the best teacher. By these concepts, we can explore the world and become the best of ourselves.\n\n\n_This post is in response to the #Hivereachout initiative._\n\nThank you for reading.\n\n_I love, I care, and I forgive_\n\n_I remain @peckypeace_\n\nPosted Using [InLeo Alpha](https://inleo.io/@peckypeace/knowledge-vs-experience-the-foundation-for-gaining-confidence-kr1)",

So her are some advantages of knowledge and it disadvantages.and some benefit of  applied knowledge include;\n1.Relevance;people pay for what the don't know.and accolade is given to the source of the knowledge.so knowledge is now sold for high price abd given upper most priority. \n2.Power:knowledge knonw a subject  matters set you at an advantageous side over a person without knowledge.\n3.Save time: knowledge here Save wastage of time.cos the person has full idea when doing a works goes straight to the point.\n4.Save from danger: a person with knowledge has idea of the does and don't of anything he/does do he his Save from danger and lot more \nAnd the disadvantages of not having knowledge include:\n1.wast of time;some without a knowledge of waste time beating around the bush because he don't know what his doing\n2.danger;if a person don't know where his going danger is inevitable.cause he may even give vital information of life and death to the wrong person.\n3.Low self esteem: a person without knowledge feel an emptiness which can lead to low self esteem either from friends, family, society and even one self.\n4.Depression;awareness brings enlightenment to any problem so a person without that knowledge remains depressed cos he feels like not been accepted and many more.\n  So in everything knowledge is key.but knowing without putting into practice is danger.\n\nOn the other hand what is experience?\n\nExperience Is having applied the knowledge,gotten over and over  for a period of time doing an act over and over againt. So you now see that just having knowledge without putting it into practice is just like giving a man a map of you destination on tge otger hand afraid of the price it may cost you.now the problem is not that you dont know but your scared of the day to day price.so you see experience has to do with the active state of knowledge.it not all about saying I can I can, but as I say I do,that what bring about experience day to day practice good or bad .but as you continue you now channel you energy to the good experience. \n   As i end  my advice here is that you cannot achieve anything if you just stop by having only the knowledge alone expect you start applying it till it becomes an experience for you.and I must say experience is the best teacher of knowledge. So please let encourage those around. \n Note : all image are mine\nThank for reading.\n\n\nPosted Using [InLeo Alpha](https://inleo.io/@realmanasseh/knowledge-and-experience--36f)",

The goal was to, primarily, raise awareness of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), a rare genetic condition of which my son has. The secondary goal was to raise the funds to build an accessible playground at his school, with the option of building more at other schools where students would benefit from them. To make people’s time, or monetary contribution worthwhile, I wanted to walk 79 kilometres on the 7th of September. The reason for the number 79 featuring so heavily is because there are 79 exons on the dystrophin gene, which is the gene, that when effected, causes DMD.\n\n<center>\n![IMG_2457.jpeg](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/d-a-d/EoGrZe2noit6q1zG2KSqPJnab9R1XPXwriPEKtoz4SHnM6fVeRE2aMze5GvPw5GJpmv.jpeg)\n<sup>At the starting line, ready to get going.</sup>\n</center>\n\nBeing the first year of the event, the plan was relatively simple. Use a local walking track to complete 12km loops before branching off to go to my son’s school for the final few kilometres and to finish the walk there during the culmination of their sports day.\n\nThis year, the walk took place on the 20th of September, to coincide with the aforementioned sports day. As they were already going to have the infrastructure of a large, all school event in place, it made sense to run it on this day instead of a couple of week earlier where they would need to create another large school event which really seemed unsustainable. Despite wanting to have the 7/9 play a fairly major role in the event, I was happy for the slight alteration. 7/9 is already a large day on the Duchenne calendar, being World Duchenne Awareness Day, so moving it made the awareness raising aspect last all the more longer.\n\nDue to the length of the walk, it was not going to be achievable on the one day. Because we were running it to end during the school event, we were constrained by their timing, so needed to be ready to finish the walk at around 2pm. With the idea of completing 5km an hour, it was determined that the walk would need to commence at 10pm on the night of the 19th and we would walk through the night.\n\nNow, I’m no small statured person, but the thought of walking alone, overnight, on semi-secluded off-road trails, still gives me pause for concern. While the paths in question are much safer than they have been in the past, I wasn’t overly keen to spend the wee hours of the morning ambling along them on my own. I’m not sure if it was my stint as a security guard or my understanding of people’s propensity for stupidity that elicited my hesitation, but I wasn’t too sure about completing this portion of the walk alone. However, I was prepared to do so - the cause is worth it, but @mattclarke came to my rescue by offering his friendship and security for the overnight stint.\n\n\n![------------------------------------------------------------------------ @d-a-d ---------------------------------------------------------------.png](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/d-a-d/23swnJVUs7HKZ6Huu8v8YTQjdMza7VHo4JBMXwBnDxsF2JVa7sMT19ceJBtzWYu3ZjPDR.png)\n\n<center>\n![IMG_2458.jpeg](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/d-a-d/23tGZrLdKAsYbcFn5eohUTCSbydJ7Z5piaGX1m78oSm2w21pDfviiZGiqCJHEJngLqVBq.jpeg)\n<sup>Sorry about the blur, I took a screenshot of a video.</sup>\n</center>\n\nThe walk itself went quite smoothly. We set off at 10pm on the 19th of September to not a lot of fanfare. As we took those first few steps, I couldn’t help but ponder the future and how we could well be  launching, not just a 2024 event, but something that could grow into a huge charitable movement that will help countless families who have children with DMD.\n\nI’d been watching the weather fairly closely from the moment the day hit the 10-day forecast, and as you would expect, it was forecast to be the coldest and most likely day for rain in the whole 10! I’d already committed to walking come rain, hail or snow, so it didn’t really matter what the forecast said, but I still looked anyway. Two days out from the event, the school notified parents that it might cancel the sports day, which would have been unfortunate because I wasn’t changing the walk. (I’d already switched it once to align it with the sports day, so another switch was out of the question.) Happily, the school decided to go ahead with the allocated day as they had a suitable contingency plan in case of severe rain. While the forecast for rain was in the 90% range, it amount was quite low - 1mm to 5 or 6mm, depending on which day you looked at it.\n\nThat all said, it wasn’t surprising when, 20 minutes into the walk, it began to rain. At first it was a light mist, which was actually quite refreshing. Matt and I figured if it remained like that for the full 16 hours of the walk, it would actually be quite pleasant. But alas, it did come down a little harder. Nothing too heavy, but enough to wet us. I reckon it would have lasted maybe 15 minutes at most. It dampened the ground, but didn’t soak us through.\n\nIt was really quite peaceful walking at night, and because of the semi-secluded nature of the path we were using, it felt as if we were complete in the wilderness, despite being very much being in the suburbs. Traffic was light and getting lighter, and the tranquility of the walk settled over us. In hindsight, my mistake at this point was the pace I set. While it wasn’t a cracking, land-speed-record-setting pace, it was too fast for the duration and length of what we’d set out to achieve. I guess that was Lesson 1.\n\nAfter the second lap, we significantly shortened our lap length from the initial 12 kilometres to 1.5 kilometres. This kept us much closer to our makeshift base-camp (out cars filled with Powerade, energy drinks and snacks) and made the laps feel more achievable. \n\nFaster than I realised, it was nearing dawn and Matt was preparing to leave. A final lap together at about 6:30am and Matt said his good-byes and I continued the walk in earnest. The halfway point came at 8:00am and I’d completed a little over 40 kilometres, which, if I needed to attain 79 in 16 hours, meant that I was bang on the money to complete the walk in the allocated timeframe. What I didn’t bank on, despite regular changes of socks, was blisters. Big blisters.\n\nI probably should have changed my socks sooner after the rain, but because it rained so early into our first lap, we didn’t arrive back at the cars for another hour or so after the rain, and I think by then, the blisters had well and truely started to form, although I didn’t start feeling them for many hours to come.\n\nMy sister joined me at about 7:00am and by the halfway mark, my feet were feeling the pinch. They were the only part of my body that was sore and becoming more so every minute. I powered on into the morning and by about 10:00am, my need to rest my feet was causing my breaks to become significantly longer. I’d completed 57 kilometres and my kilometre times had exploded from about 10 minutes to well over 13 minutes. I quickly calculated the timing I’d need to complete the remaining 22 kilometres and realised that I simply wasn’t going to make it. I could hardly stand, let alone put pressure on my feet, and time was becoming more of an enemy than anything else.\n\nI’m sorry to say that I had to pull the pin. After 12 hours and 57 kilometres, I couldn’t continue. I’d pushed myself further than I felt I could’ve gone. I understand than when you feel mentally done, your body can offer so much more, but I’d gone past this, and I knew that I actually couldn’t continue and that at this point there was only one thing I could do. As I made that decision, I was already cataloguing the changes I’d be making for next year. The lessons I’d learned would be put to good use so that in 2025, I can complete the full walk.\n\n<center>\n![IMG_9415.jpeg](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/d-a-d/23ynSa2Rwq9UWWiBsnazN259G5joYB5j6qPVqGxZxBBhSXTPQb6hREKShGhRC63u7UL2z.jpeg)\n<sup>That photo doesn’t do it justice! Couldn’t put my foot flat on the ground for a week!</sup>\n</center>\n\nWhen I got home and peeled my shoes and socks off, my sister nearly passed out after looking a the soles of my feet. They were red and puffed and the right one looked like a blister that had a foot attached to it. The one from the image is still dissipating now.\n\n![------------------------------------------------------------------------ @d-a-d ---------------------------------------------------------------.png](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/d-a-d/23swnJVUs7HKZ6Huu8v8YTQjdMza7VHo4JBMXwBnDxsF2JVa7sMT19ceJBtzWYu3ZjPDR.png)\n<br>\n\nWhat did I learn from all of this, and how can I be better prepared for future walks? (Although I’m not certain that the format of walking the full 79km in one stint is feasible for a charity event moving forward.)\n\n1. Smaller laps are key.\n2. I need to lose more weight - less weight = less pressure of my feet.\n3. I need to walk longer walks in preparation (the longest I walked in training this year was 15km).\n4. I need to blister my feet more to develop really hard callouses.\n5. A slower pace at the start won’t be detrimental in the later stages of the walk.\n\nI’m sure more will crop up as I begin to plan for next year, but for now, I’ve got plenty to focus on.\n\nDespite not walking to the allocated time, we still ‘completed’ the walk at the sports day. My family walked down the 100 metre track at the conclusion of sports day (I hobbled) which was a really nice way to end the event.\n\nI’m not too sure how it will look next year, but my hope is it will be bigger and we’ll be able to reach more people to teach them about DMD. I reckon that this year, we were able to reach maybe 1000 people who’d not heard of this condition previously, which I see as a win. We didn’t raise as much money as I’d hoped, but that was a secondary goal, so I shouldn’t be too disappointed. I’ll donate what was raised to the school. They won’t be able to purchase a playground with it, but might be able to provide something accessible.\n\n<hr>\n\n![Join us on.png](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/d-a-d/241tVAY4U2bz3rrK91M6YdV5oJQ6NT5oNjioHxuZiywqpc4SVNJAWzoxg4iFXY9XqkWcw.png)",

      "body": "\nHello everyone, Good Afternoon and welcome to my blogs \n\nknowledge is the  principles and insights that one uses in making decisions. Knowledge can broadly be described as falling into two categories: explicit knowledge, which is modifiable\n![skills-3371153_1280.jpg](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/preciousgold/2458ddRFechCsrqLmRfzPsMrmtFYtL2Qp6dpLwN9eRmiWwYWhC5xnj44vYFUhwpmSe46F.jpg)[source](https://pixabay.com/photos/skills-professional-development-3371153/)\n\n\n\n\n and easily documented, or tacit knowledge, which is hardly describable using words.\n\n\n\n\nThe definition of experience is events and activities that happen in one's life over a period of time, to which one is exposed and practically involved. It refers to the lessons and insight that one gets by being directly involved in something. Experience is usually considered important for personal and professional development, as it helps to determine how people apply knowledge.\n\n Relationship between Knowledge and Experience\nKnowledge and experience are like hand in glove. However, knowledge gives one an imagination, a theoretical framework that helps one to put things in the right direction, whereas experience is the very basis on which this knowledge can be used in concrete situations. Integration of both will definitely facilitate one in making better decisions, solving problems, and hence developing further their particular set of skills.\n\n\nKnowledge is the backbone in personal development and professional success. It encourages one to work through complex difficulties, be innovative, and give something back to the field. Thus, it serves as academic currency for further learning, and besides, one will be able to produce more and efficiently in the work environment.\n\nExperience brings knowledge into life. One is able to apply theoretical knowledge that one has earlier acquired and modified according to the situational changes. Falling,  and standing up again, hence building misfortune and ability to bend with the blowing wind, involves experience. For any area of discipline, experience is predicted.\n\n\n\nThe process of learning from experience is of utmost importance. Through the reflection process of these experiences, people come to realize valuable lessons, understand strengths and weaknesses, and find out what needs to be improved. These reflective practices make experiences a rich source of knowledge for lifelong learning.\n\nKnowledge can be acquired through a number of possible avenues, including formal education, self-directed learning, mentorship, or even merely reading. Each of these methods possesses its own merits, and the degree of effectiveness usually depends upon the learning style and objectives of the individual involved. In most cases, it is beneficial to combine several approaches in order to gain a broader understanding.\n\n\nThese come through the involvement and participation in activities, internships, volunteer work, and projects which entail practical work. Different experiences broaden the perspective and make a person adaptable. All experiences are not created equal; the tougher and wider the experience, the greater the growth.\n\nBalancing Knowledge and Experience\nAny field does require a balance for effectiveness between knowledge and experience. One cannot function on mere book knowledge, as it will never give the right feedback concerning the real situation. On the other hand, experience without knowledge of principles underlying it can lead to inefficiency in operations. A ideas of both will add more competence and confidence.\n\n Conclusion\nKnowledge and experience form a whole and twined part of personal and professional growth. While knowledge provides theoretical input, experience provides practical insight. Laying emphasis on both would ultimately help in offering a whole and effective practice of learning and growth in an attempt to achieve success on variety fronts. A proper balance will bring a person mastery over their skill or field of expertise, making them more capable and prepared for the times to come.\n\n\n\n\nPosted Using [InLeo Alpha](https://inleo.io/@preciousgold/knowledge-and-experience-the-principle-of-making-decisions--4aj)",

      "body": "The rainy season is upon us and this adds new levels of difficulty in our efforts to check up on the health of the various projects we have to the dogs in the Krabi region.  Normally, when I pull up at one of the temples, the dogs come flocking from all around to greet me and get their food and treats which I use to distract them while I check them for parasites and other problems.   Lately though, the rain has kept most of the dogs hiding in their various dry spaces so I can't get a good look at them.   There is an exception though and this is at the Tiger Cave Temple.  It seems that no matter what the weather is, these good boys and girls are always ready for my arrival and run down to greet me.\n\n<center> \n![image.png](https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmVP2WP4uJfZ4yCxRyJNQ9LwLgKVMyKwkAnnhurCWMNVif/image.png)\n</center>\n\nI do try to time it so that I don't get out of the truck until the rain has paused but the other day when I got there the dogs were already surrounding my car even though it was still raining.   I will never get past the fact that I really love that these animals know the sound of my truck engine.   They don't just swarm every vehicle that pops into this very busy temple complex, this enthusiasm is reserved exclusively for Krabi Animal Welfare.  \n\n<center> \n![image.png](https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmbpZrQZenu8HE2uUoGNJv2nkvvgqgKhxuNsQJ8PcxDVd6/image.png)\n</center> \n\nEven though I do this almost every day I never get tired of the enthusiasm that a stray dog has for the simplest and smallest amount of attention.  \n\n<center> \n![image.png](https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmTfoDdNbw9dTyTSTEevp2d44eWWn4N7k2whXeqDC2F4vd/image.png)\n</center>\n\nI'm sure the dogs would rather be fed somewhere dry but unfortunately, my fur-covered friends, I simply don't have time to go and find you.  \n\n<center> \n![image.png](https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmNTzU7iwnRjSH16oFmZLRR1tu7Z6DZFJCFdKZhcRjHfju/image.png)\n</center>\n\nFortune favors the bold as they say, and the dogs that come out to greet me on my weekly check ups on this particular temple results in dozens of dogs coming out to greet me.\n\n<center> \n![image.png](https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmeS1nNMDd5JeGkAhhhneFVdDsbN6KDd9zrdrpsNPTskZc/image.png)\n</center>\n\nI believe that dogs are able to talk to one another somehow because every now and then a face that I haven't seen before will come down to get in line with the other dogs but I can tell they are a bit shy because they are not yet used to me.   It is kind of funny because although they are initially hesitant to trust me, it only takes 1 or 2 weeks before they are the ones enthusiastically running towards the parking lot when my truck approaches.\n\n<center> \n![image.png](https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmNuK85nYdbJfnhydgmR9Gs3A23FRvs6yz4V9FBYqHn73T/image.png)\n</center>\n\nBecause of the amount of time I spend at this place some of the dogs come to me not just seeking snacks, but to get affection as well.   The dogs at Tiger Cave are much more accustomed to people being around than some of the other places I visit but I once again want to tell people out there that you should NEVER approach a dog like this that you do not know.  Even though I have been working in this charity for many years I always approach dogs that I have not met assuming they are going to bite me.   It is just the smart thing to do.  \n\n<center> \n![image.png](https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmSq6JfVmKAsxsE48NHryEjEqWUh42bx6Jn6MofFR76SfU/image.png)\n</center>\n\nI am happy to report that of the dozens of dogs I interacted with during this week's visit to Tiger Cave Temple that only one of the dogs showed any sign of sickness/injury/infestation and this was a very minor tick problem that was easily solved with a Bravecto snack.   The next time I see this guy those ticks will all be gone.\n\n<center> \n![image.png](https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmTwsUaA8mkPsMPRWLmRfZC55US56u1yyFVn3dvo6ntGBb/image.png)\n</center>\n\nThe week isn't all great news though unfortunately.  We have seen a decline in donations and are at a position now where we are starting to run out of food reserves.  Hopefully our upcoming fundraiser will prove fruitful so that we don't have to cut back on the rations that we are providing to the hundreds of stray dogs and cats that we look after in the Krabi region.\n\n<hr> \nif you would like to see how you can help out or simply spread the word, please visit our website at\n\n<h3> http://krabianimalwelfare.org </h3>\n\n<center> ![21462758_174743779763179_4154543215066704521_n.jpg](https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmXHEhXj4e6AzsbAJKsFo8csozuoq1uUcMSdFQTYifzi55/21462758_174743779763179_4154543215066704521_n.jpg) </center> \n\n<center> <sub> Krabi Animal Welfare is a charity run entirely by volunteers and are a registered non-profit organization in Thailand and the U.K..
