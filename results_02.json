Charity begins at Home.\nWith the designated community being the wonderful [ThoughtfulDailyPost](https://inleo.io/communities/hive-109288)\n\n\n### Brilliant topic ... I am huge fan of charity and most importantly being charitable!  ...\n\n\n\n### Unconditional Giving ~ What a feeling\nMany of you will know I am a big fan of manners and I believe it is a dying thing. \n\nMind your p's and q's is what I say ..\n\nAre you a p and q sayer? Do you even know what the fluff I am on about!\n\n https://img.inleo.io/DQmUghCGp4aSPyCapRmxg81Ud6xex8NQ4DKN5aL5Zososrd/image.png \n\n\nYour please and thank you. And saying sorry or apologising, why do so many especially the younger ones not do this.\n\nHehe and then hi and bye, they don't do that anymore half the time either!\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/xye7wlA.png\n\n**I digress....**(well there's a shock ... not!)\n\nI was brought up to give up my seat to women or the elderly, to help ladies across the road, to hold open doors for people and a whole wadge more ....\n\nI mean it is common courtesy in my book and we should be doing as a matter of routine.\n\n### Talking of books ...\n\nI normally donate my books I have read to a charity shop, although sometimes I use this big green bin....\n\n<center>https://img.inleo.io/DQmXmkYz2ucXUTH9pqZ5fVAKg3jGtdJehiiqKK1Kx5n7fEz/image.png</center> \n\n... and speaking of charity ...\n\nIt is fun with a big F browsing through charity shops.These are run by charities and people volunteer their time. To me they are real charity shops. I have volunteered my time in the past for an animal one in another town, this post is spurring me on to see about volunteering in one of our local shops. Especially as last week we were in the Cancer UK one, and ran in to a woman from Mrs T's crochet club who has started volunteering there.\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/xye7wlA.png\n\n### Charity begins at Home ... Which Home?\n\nI live in Scotland in the UK. We have always had poverty in Scotland. We have always had undernourished children, we had a massive drug problem. Sex trafficking exists, child prostitution exists. I could on and on.\n\nWe have problems that need sorted. We have thosands of Scottish families in inadequate housing.\n\nI remember seeing Billy Connolly the Scottish comedian at one of his shows years ago and he brought up an intriguing point...\n\nWe have all these problems in Scotland, kids starving etc so why are sending all this money to help people overseas when we can't even help our own people!\n\nIt might be an over exaggeration but you get the point.\n\n### So does charity begin in your house or your country?\n \n https://img.inleo.io/DQmTujTvMtFAoYh6FPtFfLVmzpajCzk4wHBrdUXibQ6Gam5/image.png \n\n I am a sucker for animals anywhere.\n\nHere you can see our local pdsa charity shop. \n\n[PDSA](https://www.pdsa.org.uk/) is the vet charity for pets in need, working to keep people and pets together\n\nI must admit I do love animals and quite often prefer the company of animals to people. Although being a Rangers football fan, many opponents say we are animals haha!\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/xye7wlA.png\n\nI am a sucker for a good cause, and my father took great delight in telling people that I would give a total stranger  the shirt of my back.\n\nTravelling the world working I had the pleasure to meet and get involved in several cultures and have sponsored animals and even people.\n\n### Once I got a reprimand from my father, about charity starting at home... \n\nWhen I worked in Gabon, I was a fluffing nutter. Swam in croc infested lakes, jaunts into the jungle all that sort of thing.\n\nOne weekend we had a full weekend, so a few of decided it would be a great idea to take a dug out tree trunk wooden canoe with an outboard motor and  go up the river and camp out somewhere.\n\nWe had a machete each, a couple of bottles of water and loads of bevvy... (Bevvy being Scottish for alcohol).\n\nLong story short, we went for a walk into the jungle next morning and got lost and I mean truly death expecting lost.\n\nWe did find a village comprising four huts. They were so friendly and I went back a few times, and ended up sponsoring a sister and brother through school and then through University in France.\n\nWhen I got divorced, my exwife won a Â£50 thousand pound settlement fee, which was quite a tall order to get the money together. During that time, my standing order for the kids tuition was rejected.\n\nFather found out and went in his stern voice. Edward sort your self first laddie before you can sort others. I was in my twenties being treated like a kid lol.\n\n### So yeah, sort yourself first then you can be charitable in a monetary sense.\n\n### But you can always be thoughtful ....\n\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/xye7wlA.png\n\n\n\n### Thanks for visiting and I hope you enjoyed my response to the prompt.\n\n### Sources and Reference documents\nThis article is an entry for this month's Inleo writing initiative #julyinleo\n\nYou can find all the details in [this thread](https://inleo.io/threads/view/leogrowth/re-leothreads-qrgqdauj)\n\nThis prompt is **Day 18 !

      "body": "Looks like this is the year for me to start contributing heavily, or to speed up my contribution to different community projects. I've been doing this in the past too, but at this stage of my life, I feel like I need to do more. There are a few projects I have my eyes on so far and today I'd like to share them with you. Maybe motivate you to find similar projects close to you and join as many as you can. Helping is good.  \n\n![Knitting.jpg](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/erikah/23tc1iAQQEZcMds4ZaVCK8d3XPGYaL7dTit8caWQ7AMrWtH9bvJQhHurzw1x1QWnwWtAv.jpg)\n\n## World Record\n\nThe whole thing started last year in December, when one day I came across a very unusual Christmas tree, made of colorful knitted pieces. To be honest, I've never seen anything similar so far and pretty soon I found out the story behind the unique Christmas tree.  \n\nThe initial project meant to break the world record of the longest knitted scarf. The attempt most likely failed and the organizers decided to display some of the works in form of a Christmas tree. At that time I regretted not knowing about the project earlier, as it has been going on for a whole year, but it was too late. \n\nNot long ago I saw an article on one of the social media platforms, announcing the beginning of a new attempt of establishing a new world record. The organizers shared the details and the requirements of the project and for me it was like getting a chance to contribute. This is how I started knitting in my pare time. \n\nThe truth is, this project for me is more than just trying to contribute to breaking the world record. A few years ago, I was able to collect a bunch of yarn. You know, old pullovers, sweaters no one wanted to use anymore and used the yarn to make two granny square blankets. I've always wanted to make a granny square blanket and finally made two. But there was a bunch of yarn left so I thought this is the best occasion to recycle those old yarns I don't use anymore. \n\n![20240629_153436a.jpg](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/erikah/EoK7MEyzxPCW3TH51nr54x8wTRnvbq9Sx81nHm7mHo2JnxkhwQLPUPJpKihJuDyMRFE.jpg)\n\nWhen i opened my drawer, this yarn was the first I saw and could not resist. I love this yarn and even though it's one piece, I could have knitted a scarf for myself, I chose to use it for the project. It's a thick yarn and colorful too, so using a pattern here was not an option. I loved it' but the truth is, it is rolling up on its own, which is not good, so most likely I'm going to redo the whole thing as I don't like it. \n\n![20240706_143902a.jpg](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/erikah/EoGznssrwG3rDmHzSzKF19ivtvZfMiq5TyVzKBc2T7FsMzeN9F9otfyh9VCVCaiHQGg.jpg)\n\nThe next step in the project was adding colors and using all the leftover yarn I have. What I loved the most here was that I had no obligation or restriction apart from the width of the scarf. Otherwise I was free to use what I had, the way I saw fit, so my plan was to mix as many colors and types of yarn as I had available. \n\n![20240630_103202a.jpg](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/erikah/EoCi2UfuybhqTSucbBmsiS5bgnysLWRfQFxNCpZksbjuTyrQgokv8J5k8fvahhoL9tk.jpg)\n\nFor the next piece I chose this pattern, which we call *rice pattern* in Hungarian. It's a very simple one, but it keeps the knitting straight and doesn't let it roll up at the edges. \n\n![20240709_135616a.jpg](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/erikah/EpGSZhRi7dn2JZBjaMvn6f4YrHZQGJeLL15wiE74VF6bF9W1z2z7ofjxz4dq3qKpeJq.jpg)\n\nThis is how things stand right now. So far I have three uneven pieces as far as length is regarded, but I have one year to complete my part. I still need to hide the lose ends and merge the pieces, but there's time for that. As I progress with it, I'm thinking of incorporating different patterns and my next post will be even more interesting. \n\n## Books To Readers\n\nThe truth is, I've selected a big pile of books last year, books that I don't need anymore and have been planning to speak with the library, to drop them off one nice day. That nice day has never come and I'm glad because last week a new opportunity presented itself. \n\nThis book swapping thing is gaining weight and spreading like fire. I love it to be honest, because this is a good way to offer books to those who are interested and swap your books you don't need with different ones. No money is going to exchange hands, it's a free initiative and it helps and benefits those who still have time to read. \n\nLast week I spoke with the owner of a holiday home, a wooden cabin up in the mountains, a big one, with 32 beds, and I'm going to ship the books there. That's a place where entertainment is limited as people go there to rest and enjoy nature, so reading a book before bed is the best you can do. I saw their collection, which is a nice one, but my books will still be a nice addition to it. \n\n## Help By Donating\n\nThis is a bit different, but maybe the most important. I came across an add a month ago, advertising a charity shop, where you can donate your clothes and not only. Those items can be bought by whoever is interested, but none of them has is priced, so the price is left to be decided by the buyer. The income will then be used to sustain the shop and to buy the necessary items for those in need. This type of charity is a common thing in many countries, but it's not so common in my country. Personally I'm glad such occasion exists as I have many things I don't use anymore, so finding a new owner for them while helping others is the best solution in my eyes. \n\nI'm also curious to see what they are selling, maybe I can be a buyer and help them by paying for a few items I find interesting. You never know. Most likely I'm going to be back with an update about the shop. Can't wait. \n\nIt's time to get rid of the things I don't use anymore, to make room for new things. No point in collecting useless items while space is so limited. \n\n<center><img src=\"https://images.hive.blog/DQmfDaSmTz3y8oavngRrr5mmVhrTXheYoEU4qhGUS7pq3xh/HiveDivider.png\"></center>\n\nIf you're a newbie, you may want to check out these guides:\n- [Communities Explained - Newbie Guide](https://peakd.com/hive-174578/@erikah/communities-explained-newbie-guide)\n- [Cross Posting And Reposting Explained, Using PeakD](https://peakd.com/hive-174578/@erikah/cross-posting-and-reposting-explained-using-peakd)\n- [Hive Is Not For Me](https://peakd.com/hive-150329/@erikah/hive-is-not-for-me)\n- [How To Pump Your Reputation Fast - Newbie Guide](https://peakd.com/hive-150329/@erikah/how-to-pump-your-reputation-fast-newbie-guide)\n- [Tips And Tricks & Useful Hive Tools For Newbies](https://peakd.com/hive-150329/@erikah/tips-and-tricks-and-useful-hive-tools-for-newbies)\n- [More Useful Tools On Hive - Newbie Guide](https://peakd.com/hive-150329/@erikah/more-useful-tools-on-hive-newbie-guide)\n- [Community List And Why It Is Important To Post In The Right Community](https://peakd.com/hive-174578/@erikah/community-list-and-why-it-is-important-to-post-in-the-right-community)\n- [Witnesses And Proposals Explained - Newbie Guide](https://peakd.com/hive-150329/@erikah/wintesses-and-proposals-explained-newbie-guide)\n- [To Stake, Or Not To Stake - Newbie Guide](https://peakd.com/hive-150329/@erikah/to-stake-or-not-to-stake-newbie-guide)\n- [Tags And Tagging - Newbie Guide](https://peakd.com/hive-150329/@erikah/tags-and-tagging-newbie-guide)\n- [Newbie Expectations And Reality](https://peakd.com/hive-166408/@erikah/newbie-expectations-and-reality)\n- [About Dust Vote And Hive Reward Pool](https://peakd.com/hive-153850/@libertycrypto27/discover-hive-focus-on-dust-vote-hive-reward-pool-advices-for-new-users-cosa-sono-i-dust-vote-consigli-per-nuovi-utenti-engita), by libertycrypto27\n\n<center><a href=\"https://www.presearch.org/signup?rid=2058286\" target=\"_blank\">\n  <img src=\"https://presearch.org/images/rf/ban-4.jpg\" title=\"Presearch\" alt=\"presearch\" />\n</a></center>"
