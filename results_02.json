Charity begins at Home.\nWith the designated community being the wonderful [ThoughtfulDailyPost](https://inleo.io/communities/hive-109288)\n\n\n### Brilliant topic ... I am huge fan of charity and most importantly being charitable!  ...\n\n\n\n### Unconditional Giving ~ What a feeling\nMany of you will know I am a big fan of manners and I believe it is a dying thing. \n\nMind your p's and q's is what I say ..\n\nAre you a p and q sayer? Do you even know what the fluff I am on about!\n\n https://img.inleo.io/DQmUghCGp4aSPyCapRmxg81Ud6xex8NQ4DKN5aL5Zososrd/image.png \n\n\nYour please and thank you. And saying sorry or apologising, why do so many especially the younger ones not do this.\n\nHehe and then hi and bye, they don't do that anymore half the time either!\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/xye7wlA.png\n\n**I digress....**(well there's a shock ... not!)\n\nI was brought up to give up my seat to women or the elderly, to help ladies across the road, to hold open doors for people and a whole wadge more ....\n\nI mean it is common courtesy in my book and we should be doing as a matter of routine.\n\n### Talking of books ...\n\nI normally donate my books I have read to a charity shop, although sometimes I use this big green bin....\n\n<center>https://img.inleo.io/DQmXmkYz2ucXUTH9pqZ5fVAKg3jGtdJehiiqKK1Kx5n7fEz/image.png</center> \n\n... and speaking of charity ...\n\nIt is fun with a big F browsing through charity shops.These are run by charities and people volunteer their time. To me they are real charity shops. I have volunteered my time in the past for an animal one in another town, this post is spurring me on to see about volunteering in one of our local shops. Especially as last week we were in the Cancer UK one, and ran in to a woman from Mrs T's crochet club who has started volunteering there.\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/xye7wlA.png\n\n### Charity begins at Home ... Which Home?\n\nI live in Scotland in the UK. We have always had poverty in Scotland. We have always had undernourished children, we had a massive drug problem. Sex trafficking exists, child prostitution exists. I could on and on.\n\nWe have problems that need sorted. We have thosands of Scottish families in inadequate housing.\n\nI remember seeing Billy Connolly the Scottish comedian at one of his shows years ago and he brought up an intriguing point...\n\nWe have all these problems in Scotland, kids starving etc so why are sending all this money to help people overseas when we can't even help our own people!\n\nIt might be an over exaggeration but you get the point.\n\n### So does charity begin in your house or your country?\n \n https://img.inleo.io/DQmTujTvMtFAoYh6FPtFfLVmzpajCzk4wHBrdUXibQ6Gam5/image.png \n\n I am a sucker for animals anywhere.\n\nHere you can see our local pdsa charity shop. \n\n[PDSA](https://www.pdsa.org.uk/) is the vet charity for pets in need, working to keep people and pets together\n\nI must admit I do love animals and quite often prefer the company of animals to people. Although being a Rangers football fan, many opponents say we are animals haha!\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/xye7wlA.png\n\nI am a sucker for a good cause, and my father took great delight in telling people that I would give a total stranger  the shirt of my back.\n\nTravelling the world working I had the pleasure to meet and get involved in several cultures and have sponsored animals and even people.\n\n### Once I got a reprimand from my father, about charity starting at home... \n\nWhen I worked in Gabon, I was a fluffing nutter. Swam in croc infested lakes, jaunts into the jungle all that sort of thing.\n\nOne weekend we had a full weekend, so a few of decided it would be a great idea to take a dug out tree trunk wooden canoe with an outboard motor and  go up the river and camp out somewhere.\n\nWe had a machete each, a couple of bottles of water and loads of bevvy... (Bevvy being Scottish for alcohol).\n\nLong story short, we went for a walk into the jungle next morning and got lost and I mean truly death expecting lost.\n\nWe did find a village comprising four huts. They were so friendly and I went back a few times, and ended up sponsoring a sister and brother through school and then through University in France.\n\nWhen I got divorced, my exwife won a £50 thousand pound settlement fee, which was quite a tall order to get the money together. During that time, my standing order for the kids tuition was rejected.\n\nFather found out and went in his stern voice. Edward sort your self first laddie before you can sort others. I was in my twenties being treated like a kid lol.\n\n### So yeah, sort yourself first then you can be charitable in a monetary sense.\n\n### But you can always be thoughtful ....\n\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/xye7wlA.png\n\n\n\n### Thanks for visiting and I hope you enjoyed my response to the prompt.\n\n### Sources and Reference documents\nThis article is an entry for this month's Inleo writing initiative #julyinleo\n\nYou can find all the details in [this thread](https://inleo.io/threads/view/leogrowth/re-leothreads-qrgqdauj)\n\nThis prompt is **Day 18 !

      "body": "Looks like this is the year for me to start contributing heavily, or to speed up my contribution to different community projects. I've been doing this in the past too, but at this stage of my life, I feel like I need to do more. There are a few projects I have my eyes on so far and today I'd like to share them with you. Maybe motivate you to find similar projects close to you and join as many as you can. Helping is good.  \n\n![Knitting.jpg](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/erikah/23tc1iAQQEZcMds4ZaVCK8d3XPGYaL7dTit8caWQ7AMrWtH9bvJQhHurzw1x1QWnwWtAv.jpg)\n\n## World Record\n\nThe whole thing started last year in December, when one day I came across a very unusual Christmas tree, made of colorful knitted pieces. To be honest, I've never seen anything similar so far and pretty soon I found out the story behind the unique Christmas tree.  \n\nThe initial project meant to break the world record of the longest knitted scarf. The attempt most likely failed and the organizers decided to display some of the works in form of a Christmas tree. At that time I regretted not knowing about the project earlier, as it has been going on for a whole year, but it was too late. \n\nNot long ago I saw an article on one of the social media platforms, announcing the beginning of a new attempt of establishing a new world record. The organizers shared the details and the requirements of the project and for me it was like getting a chance to contribute. This is how I started knitting in my pare time. \n\nThe truth is, this project for me is more than just trying to contribute to breaking the world record. A few years ago, I was able to collect a bunch of yarn. You know, old pullovers, sweaters no one wanted to use anymore and used the yarn to make two granny square blankets. I've always wanted to make a granny square blanket and finally made two. But there was a bunch of yarn left so I thought this is the best occasion to recycle those old yarns I don't use anymore. \n\n![20240629_153436a.jpg](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/erikah/EoK7MEyzxPCW3TH51nr54x8wTRnvbq9Sx81nHm7mHo2JnxkhwQLPUPJpKihJuDyMRFE.jpg)\n\nWhen i opened my drawer, this yarn was the first I saw and could not resist. I love this yarn and even though it's one piece, I could have knitted a scarf for myself, I chose to use it for the project. It's a thick yarn and colorful too, so using a pattern here was not an option. I loved it' but the truth is, it is rolling up on its own, which is not good, so most likely I'm going to redo the whole thing as I don't like it. \n\n![20240706_143902a.jpg](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/erikah/EoGznssrwG3rDmHzSzKF19ivtvZfMiq5TyVzKBc2T7FsMzeN9F9otfyh9VCVCaiHQGg.jpg)\n\nThe next step in the project was adding colors and using all the leftover yarn I have. What I loved the most here was that I had no obligation or restriction apart from the width of the scarf. Otherwise I was free to use what I had, the way I saw fit, so my plan was to mix as many colors and types of yarn as I had available. \n\n![20240630_103202a.jpg](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/erikah/EoCi2UfuybhqTSucbBmsiS5bgnysLWRfQFxNCpZksbjuTyrQgokv8J5k8fvahhoL9tk.jpg)\n\nFor the next piece I chose this pattern, which we call *rice pattern* in Hungarian. It's a very simple one, but it keeps the knitting straight and doesn't let it roll up at the edges. \n\n![20240709_135616a.jpg](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/erikah/EpGSZhRi7dn2JZBjaMvn6f4YrHZQGJeLL15wiE74VF6bF9W1z2z7ofjxz4dq3qKpeJq.jpg)\n\nThis is how things stand right now. So far I have three uneven pieces as far as length is regarded, but I have one year to complete my part. I still need to hide the lose ends and merge the pieces, but there's time for that. As I progress with it, I'm thinking of incorporating different patterns and my next post will be even more interesting. \n\n## Books To Readers\n\nThe truth is, I've selected a big pile of books last year, books that I don't need anymore and have been planning to speak with the library, to drop them off one nice day. That nice day has never come and I'm glad because last week a new opportunity presented itself. \n\nThis book swapping thing is gaining weight and spreading like fire. I love it to be honest, because this is a good way to offer books to those who are interested and swap your books you don't need with different ones. No money is going to exchange hands, it's a free initiative and it helps and benefits those who still have time to read. \n\nLast week I spoke with the owner of a holiday home, a wooden cabin up in the mountains, a big one, with 32 beds, and I'm going to ship the books there. That's a place where entertainment is limited as people go there to rest and enjoy nature, so reading a book before bed is the best you can do. I saw their collection, which is a nice one, but my books will still be a nice addition to it. \n\n## Help By Donating\n\nThis is a bit different, but maybe the most important. I came across an add a month ago, advertising a charity shop, where you can donate your clothes and not only. Those items can be bought by whoever is interested, but none of them has is priced, so the price is left to be decided by the buyer. The income will then be used to sustain the shop and to buy the necessary items for those in need. This type of charity is a common thing in many countries, but it's not so common in my country. Personally I'm glad such occasion exists as I have many things I don't use anymore, so finding a new owner for them while helping others is the best solution in my eyes. \n\nI'm also curious to see what they are selling, maybe I can be a buyer and help them by paying for a few items I find interesting. You never know. Most likely I'm going to be back with an update about the shop. Can't wait. \n\nIt's time to get rid of the things I don't use anymore, to make room for new things. No point in collecting useless items while space is so limited. \n\n<center><img src=\"https://images.hive.blog/DQmfDaSmTz3y8oavngRrr5mmVhrTXheYoEU4qhGUS7pq3xh/HiveDivider.png\"></center>\n\nIf you're a newbie, you may want to check out these guides:\n- [Communities Explained - Newbie Guide](https://peakd.com/hive-174578/@erikah/communities-explained-newbie-guide)\n- [Cross Posting And Reposting Explained, Using PeakD](https://peakd.com/hive-174578/@erikah/cross-posting-and-reposting-explained-using-peakd)\n- [Hive Is Not For Me](https://peakd.com/hive-150329/@erikah/hive-is-not-for-me)\n- [How To Pump Your Reputation Fast - Newbie Guide](https://peakd.com/hive-150329/@erikah/how-to-pump-your-reputation-fast-newbie-guide)\n- [Tips And Tricks & Useful Hive Tools For Newbies](https://peakd.com/hive-150329/@erikah/tips-and-tricks-and-useful-hive-tools-for-newbies)\n- [More Useful Tools On Hive - Newbie Guide](https://peakd.com/hive-150329/@erikah/more-useful-tools-on-hive-newbie-guide)\n- [Community List And Why It Is Important To Post In The Right Community](https://peakd.com/hive-174578/@erikah/community-list-and-why-it-is-important-to-post-in-the-right-community)\n- [Witnesses And Proposals Explained - Newbie Guide](https://peakd.com/hive-150329/@erikah/wintesses-and-proposals-explained-newbie-guide)\n- [To Stake, Or Not To Stake - Newbie Guide](https://peakd.com/hive-150329/@erikah/to-stake-or-not-to-stake-newbie-guide)\n- [Tags And Tagging - Newbie Guide](https://peakd.com/hive-150329/@erikah/tags-and-tagging-newbie-guide)\n- [Newbie Expectations And Reality](https://peakd.com/hive-166408/@erikah/newbie-expectations-and-reality)\n- [About Dust Vote And Hive Reward Pool](https://peakd.com/hive-153850/@libertycrypto27/discover-hive-focus-on-dust-vote-hive-reward-pool-advices-for-new-users-cosa-sono-i-dust-vote-consigli-per-nuovi-utenti-engita), by libertycrypto27\n\n<center><a href=\"https://www.presearch.org/signup?rid=2058286\" target=\"_blank\">\n  <img src=\"https://presearch.org/images/rf/ban-4.jpg\" title=\"Presearch\" alt=\"presearch\" />\n</a></center>",

      "body": "Hello friends, welcome to my blog this beautiful day. This is your special friend @adaezeinchrist. I am so happy to be here today for this contest.  What does charity begins at home means?\n https://img.inleo.io/DQmcwzJCzCgmpXxyiAiFrZ1tftMbMPyxiQkpySZydejqBqw/IMG_20230618_081905_566.jpg \n\nYour good work should begin from your immediate environment. This is what charity begins at home means. We have alot of people who are known for their generosity outside their home or environment. We have lots of them who can boast of people that they have helped to raise up to a particular level in live because of their philanthropist lifestyle. But guess what? All of these are from outside that people know that. His family members might even be dying of hunger. His siblings may not have anything that they have benefited from his philanthropist lifestyle. We are believing that through post such lifestyle will change and we will begin to do the good work first from home and not just outside. \n\nI WANT TO SHARE THE STORY OF MAN WHO DISPLAYS THIS CHARACTER VERY WELL.\n\nThis man use to be my neighbor. He lives some houses away from mine when I was a little girl still growing. Though I was still naive and don't know much about life, but I had so many things about that man that thought me alot of lessons as a little girl. This man had money and he don't even know how to use his money because it was too much. I know of his siblings back then because there all live together with their parents in the same place. But when the man began to make money he left them and got himself a very good apartment in the city and left his siblings together with the parents behind. All that we started hearing about him was that he had lots of money and he was busy moving around town with ladies getting them different gift. As at that time his parents still lived in a rented apartment, but we had that he bought a very big house for his girl friend. It did not stop there, he spoils her with lots of gifts and other good things of life. \n\nHis parents eat from hand to mouth and it never meant anything to him. He hardly visits. Even when they sent him a message that they need some money to settle some needs at home, he never responded. It continued and his parents became tired of asking him for anything and just let him be. \n\nThis may still be happening to some one of some where. We need to know that once e start making money, the first people that will benefit from it are the people in our environment. Our family, our neighbors. Our brothers and sisters. These are the ones that should enjoy our money.\n\nI also had someone before in my family that was doing exactly like this man I just described. He has all the money, but we don't know anything about it. We only hear people outside praising him for all that he is doing for them. But we the close relatives know nothing about it. He is good outside and bad inside. What kind of a person is that? When the people around you can't say anything good about you only the people outside, then the good work have not began. It can only start when we showcase what we have with the people within before it will get to the people without.\n\nThis is my entry to the hive-reachout prompt and inleo day 18 #julyinleo.

Dear parents this is for you don't be too busy for your children they need love care and attention and if they don't get it they tend to move elsewhere to get it and the outcome might not be good.\nHow to we spread love\nCollaborated neighbors and community members to address shared challenges\n Encourage personal development\n prioritize family needs and allocate resources accordingly\nvolunteer in your community\nIn conclusion charity begins at home is it timeless wisdom that promotes a culture of responsibility self sufficiency, and community building by embracing this concept individuals can create an effect of positive change fostering stronger families community and societies\nWe need to extend the show of love to everyone out there. A lot of people are going through so many things that they can't share, Just a show of love could save many lives out there which includes emotional support, attention and financial support.\nAlways help your fellow neighbour, Spread love and let it lead.\nLove yourself first and let it spread\nCharity begins at home.\nIt starts with you, take action\nhttps://inleo.io/@leogrowth/july-inleo-monthly-prompts-je8\n\nPosted Using [InLeo Alpha](https://inleo.io/@ayomiposy/hivereachout-communitycharity-begins-at-home-day-18-inleo-monthly-prompt-2yz)",

Charity isn't limited to that aspect of chores only, it spreads across rendering support, giving to others, showing that we care, etc but how do we spread the love and care to others if we don't know how to love ourselves, families, neighbors, etc it is a question of understanding that the act of caring and giving starts with oneself before it can spread out to others. \n \n\n![IMG_20230222_121850_76.jpg](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/glorydee/23sK9KUdbbPFdJhQCXDDSPrHzf9gk7RmHcbHaFRVQC6oEXe5VFC71tAhZqjpcaX36LH86.jpg)\n\n\n\nWhat this means is that we must first learn all of these at home, especially at an early age, during childhood as this is the best way for the act of charity to stay with us for long even into our adulthood. In fact, we first learn all these virtuous aspects of generosity, of recognizing the other’s need, giving unquestioningly, and deriving pleasure out of giving within the four walls of our house among our loved ones. These lessons are learned at a young age and are the foundation of our ethical and social principle that teaches us how to interact with our society.\n\n\nAs a mum myself now, I have already start instilling this basic teaching of charity to my daughters, and do you know that these teachings are from our day to day interaction, for instance my eldest daughter won a pack of pencil in school after a quiz competition with her classmates, she was happy with her gift as she showed everyone while we were at her grandma's house including her cousins, so they asked that she gives them one each, they were five in total including her younger sister and she had a dozen of pencil in the pack, at first, she was reluctant to share, you see this is where the case of charity begins at home comes in, if she doesn't learn to share the little she has at this age of 6 and I let her continue that way, it would be hard for her to change as she grows older, so I calmly explain to her the reason why we need to give, especially when we have, and in times when we don't have there is also something known as sacrifice, she obeyed and gave them all one each and I asked her to tell me how many people she just made happy with her pencils, she replied five, and how does that make you feel? I asked her, happy, she replied. Guess what? Not only did she give to her sister and cousins, that feeling she felt made her extend her generosity even to our neighbours children leaving her with just one which  is okay  for her at that moment.\n\n\n![IMG_20240310_134150_630.jpg](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/glorydee/243qRWtpm11bXUv68uMcATX17KCUQDMiC6M5vWujZDCTHK7YHFd2Fcj6c2qETYaZ8ts9y.jpg)\n\n\n\n Just by that single teaching of charity at home, the love spread out, and I hope it continues into her adulthood. As it’s important to note that phrase “charity begins at home” doesn’t mean “charity ends at home. ” Instead, the phrase stresses that home is that initial point where one learns how to become nice to other people and help them. It is almost inevitable when you have learned to be generous to the people close to you that you will also extend it to others as well. Look around you, J guess you would agree that from observations that children who were taught to be nice and generous at home grow up to be adults that are sensitive to their neighbors or friends needs.\n \n\n\n\n![IMG_20240310_134117_433.jpg](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/glorydee/242hYS6pT1uVR9Yk1ho7an6295fdv5CViQL7EtBtkzQoXngXp2Sqch78mGsQyrNMw4DVK.jpg)\n\n\n\n \n Unfortunately, in today’s world where, the constant exposure to pain and suffering, for the sake of helping people has made people give up on charity, people are rather scared for their safety, but look at it from another angle, how about those that genuinely need our support, do not because you were offended by a family or friend you rendered assistance to make you give up in your charitable deeds, know that the best way to do your best with charity is never expecting anything in return rather, focus on the joy you give and be contented with that.\nOnly then would we keep spreading love and joy and hopefully make the world a better place, spread love to yourself, your family, friends and also learn to extend that same love to your society.\n\n\n**This post is inspired by the #julyinleo [monthly topics](https://inleo.io/threads/view/leogrowth/re-leothreads-rgwuw2zr), day 18, do check it out for more info and he inspired as well.*\n\n*All images used are mine*\n\n</div>\n\n# Thank you for reading.❤❤\n \n\n \n \n\nPosted Using [InLeo Alpha](https://inleo.io/@glorydee/the-importance-of-teaching-charity-to-children-92r)\n\nPosted Using [InLeo Alpha](https://inleo.io/@glorydee/the-importance-of-teaching-charity-to-children-92r)",

      "body": "In life, charity i.e. good deeds are one of the best endeavors anyone can engaged in because life counts by the positive impacts and influence one had on others and not a life lived for oneself. Charity i.e. good deeds borne out of love and passion with a good motive or intention is a good thing especially to someone who cannot repay it back or the less privileged. It takes been sacrificial, selfless and compassionate to be charitable. Charity isn't first about how more or how small it is, but about the liberality of the mind (soul).\n\nCharity they say: \"begins from home\". Charitable deeds ought to start from one's immediate family, home or locality because of what importance is it when outsiders are enjoying one's liberality and good deeds while those of one's family, home or locality aren't. The first beneficiary of one's charitable deed ought to be one's family, home and locality because if otherwise, it will be a wrong signal to those outside and it will show a bias, partiality and inconsistency in one's good deed.\n\n![](https://images.ecency.com/DQmVHqGsajU6F5BaVRFW1FahXxVsx4tJEiEQZNhjhE1RPwh/pexels_photo_6646847.jpeg) [Source](https://www.pexels.com/photo/a-cardboard-box-with-food-label-beside-a-charity-sign-and-paper-cups-6646847/)\n\nA popular saying goes thus: \"No place like home\" which is true. The influence and the impart, the love and reception, the care and nurturing and many great things one enjoyed from one's family primarily and neighbors, acquittances, friends etc can never be over emphasized. It is never too much to show charitable deeds to ones immediate family and locality because at the end of it all, everyone came from a family and will return to such. Giving charitably to others while neglecting one's family, home and locality isn't a good thing to do at all. \n\nA story goes thus of a rich young man who gives charitably to people and even has philanthropic gestures which made him popular in his place of abode but neglected the people who raised him i.e. his own people and prioritize the outsiders more than his own people. His people and those of his origin on seeing and hearing all he did for others while neglecting them called his attention to it but he didn't take it serious. A big opportunity arose for him but he needs a strong confirmation from his clan because they want to know him alongside his origin for traceability, transparency and integrity sake. \n\n![](https://images.ecency.com/DQmf5NEtzuv9a5c9TCDXTLGtD3z5JgTuXxZSrW5MDKDM9Vf/pexels_photo_6995109.jpeg) [Source](https://www.pexels.com/photo/volunteers-in-a-loft-with-donations-6995109/)\n\nThe rich young man haven known what transpired in the past because of his dealings with his family and origin as regards his charitable deeds was ashamed and reluctant to meet them. He later summoned the courage and went back apologising for his wrongs haven realised such with a promise to make amends. The family out of the love they have for him accepted him and granted his request. This shows that family, home and locality are key in one's life and must never be neglected especially in charitable deeds. Also, it shows how strong family bond is and the reason for the saying that: \"Blood is thicker than water\". \n\nCharity is good as we need to show love to humanity by reaching out to others especially the less privilege and those in need, however, there should be a balance to it so that one's family, home and locality are not neglected or forgotten.

I remember my mom telling stories of how my grand father preferred taking care of there cousins over them being his immediate children, he even had to pay WAEC (West African Examination Council) examination fee for one of her cousin while my mother almost missed the exam. Such an attitude will definitely leave marks of hatred in the mind of a child. One should first love and take care of him or herself, his immediate family, his neighbors and then the general public. If you leave any of the level unattended to before elevating to the next, then you must know it that you are not doing things the right way. \n\n\n\n\n![pexels-cottonbro-3171151.jpg](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/ernesto6402/23xetLNfChQfGFTtr8DLKJzRPnjrJR96JUDZ82ga9QE6PG7RmQTzU3C4pBX7dFTin34pG.jpg)\n\n[Source](https://www.pexels.com/photo/selective-focus-photography-of-man-preparing-food-beside-smiling-women-and-kids-3171151/)\n\n---\n\nCharity indeed begins at home. I have always believed in love and what love can do, but one cannot give what he or she does not have. You can only give love when you have one within you, and if you really have love in you it will certainly be visible to every one around you. I speak of love this much because a true charity must be defined by love, it is the presence of love that makes an act charitable. To define a true act of charity then, one must scrutinized such an act to see if love really exist in it, only then can it be charitable. \n\n---\n\nIf one's charitable acts reaches the general public before his home or immediate family, then such acts must be void of love and they are by implication not really charitable. In most cases, such charities are void of true kindness, they are mostly done with hidden motives and that certainly cannot be considered as real charity. Our homes are our base, where we can trace our roots back to, they are what gives our identity. If man a then leaves his origin in shambles to better the lives of those he has bearly met, there is certainly something wrong and such a man is certainly not doing things right. He or she probably lacks love.\n\n---\n\nOne's home is his/her responsibility. My grandfather in the case of my mother and her siblings left his responsibility to attend to need of the extended family and that is certainly not the right to do. It all begins from home and how well you are able to handle home will determine how well you can handle the general public. How well you are able to provide for your family will validate your charity to the general public. You can only be truly charitable when you have done things right, with that we can determine if an act is truly charitable. \n\n---\n\nDo not get me wrong though. Putting smiles on people's faces even though you have barely met them is beautiful, it in fact bring about inner joy to the one who does such, but such joy can only be accorded to those who have done things right; those who made sure there responsibilities have been attended to. Giving a hundred dollars to charity when your family can barely feed would be an act of foolishness. One does not give what he does not have, you can give love only when you have one in you.

      "body": "<div class'text-justify'>\n\nCharity is a very popular word, many understands it while others don't really get the gleams of what it actually means. To me I will say that ***charity is love*** and the kind of love being spoken of here is a sincere love. Many profess love with their own definition. What I mean by their own definition is that they love the way they want to love because it is from a selfish mind. Charity in a storming sense is not selfish but theirs is in that way that they consider themselves first. How what they want to do will first be of benefit to them. So if anything they wish to do is not of any direct benefits to them, they lay it a side. This one is not charity at all. Charity originally is not self centered, first it considers how a thing will benefit others before considering himself. In this case, I am not saying one should die for another no, but there is this place of putting people ahead of whatsoever we want to do beginning from home.\n\nImagine taking up a project for a community and one don't have a direct benefit of it or there is not even a family member who will benefit from the project or someone of your faith.\n\n https://img.inleo.io/DQmaY832D2dGBaeshnZDfQZvQ88NjqX8AZocBVJ19NicLhq/1000147074.jpg \n\nThis topic reminds me of some time past when I went to a school for some charity work. This is what I love doing always not for the gain of it or my faith sake. One of the schools I visited a teacher began to talk that we are just after the people from our faith. When I heard that it didn't go down well with me because first I didn't put that into consideration at all. Now she drew my attention to it and I was curious to know out of the 5 pupils how many are of my faith. Finally I discovered that it's just 2 out of the 5, the contact person was so worth bad at her colleague because at least for a while she have know me and how I operate. So I just decided to let it go.\n\nCharity I strongly believe should take root from the house, because I have seen lots of persons who go out and are well valued and know as alm givers outside but their home is suffering. Some men are so kind when they go out but when they return home they become the lion of the tribe of their family which is so bad. It is not bad to enforce discipline in the Life of the family but let all be done with love.\n\nAnother point I want to make is that, ones giving most not always be something so big. A times we wait for that big opportunity for us to give to people we forget that we can start with the little we have. I don't have to be that big, as little as your good old clothes can go a long way in helping someone out there. At least for times in every year we go out to villages where we share some relieve materials and freebies to them. Just last weekend of last month we went to a village, on our way to that place I felt we were on the wrong part because of the nature of the road. This community didn't have an access road, we prayed with them for the government to remember them so they can construct a road for them. We also encouraged them to develop themselves in both skills and academically so they can be equipped to help themselves.\n\n https://img.inleo.io/DQmQVUZwd24AFfF6VbvMGbifXcKD5nbRVAqMmeWrTTGTfss/1000146296.jpg \n\nGenuine Charity does not lie and whatever way it is done it's always appreciated because of the sincerity in it. Charity when started in a little way also have the tendency to grow. The only challenge there is the starting. As we all know that starting a thing is not easy and much more is the maintenance of it because it takes the genuine at heart to do so, the most discouraging aspect is when the people it's been done for looks down on it because of their personal reasons which I shared above.\n\nMy entry to the hive-reachout prompt and the day 18 #julyinleo prompt with the topic Charity Begins At Home.

Where no one has to complain about the hardships in the economy and so on.\n\nWe all agreed that we are the government, and we do not expect the government to come down from their places to start feeding each and every one of us. Sometimes, when we all abuse the government, I do shake my head because, believe me, we have also lost it. We stop doing the little things we need to do for people.\n\n![White Red Open Donation Instagram Post_20240719_073316_0000.png](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/moremoney28/AJhXgf95hZoMtTBra6MHPRL1qfzYatsoivtXQThswgTshnT3zapTrvBGpoTdLLh.png)\n\nWe all know how hard the economy is. The best we could all do to help each other is to give charity. What do I mean by that? Our family should be our responsibility. Our community should be our responsibility, and our friends should also be our responsibility.\nOnly if we all know that we have responsibilities to take care of will we know that the meaning of charity begins at home.\n\nBack in some years, I could remember very well how we relate to our neighbors. I meant, we are both doing different religions. And believe me, that wasn't a barrier between the two of us. I could remember that when it's their time for celebration, they will bring out a big boul, and we all eat together. My parents will eat with their parents, and we, the children, will also eat together. You will hardly even know who is among us. This is because we all do it as one. Imagine being that good to your neighbors. Only if we didn't cook, and my mom cooks most times. \n\nThere is absolutely nothing that we cook that we won't cook ourselves. In fact, at some point, you will not know who gave birth to me or their children.\nThis wasn't because they couldn't afford what to eat, or because we couldn't afford what to eat. We are just showing love to each other. I believe the word charity begins at home and starts with us. If you are not good with your family or your neighbors, how on earth did you want to be good to the communities?\nWe all forgot we had a role to play. I understand that helping people can be so funny sometimes; I've had some cases. But that doesn't mean I would stop helping.\n\n\n\n![Random Acts of Kindness Day Instagram Post_20240719_073915_0000.png](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/moremoney28/AKRBWbgrnrt5VmiZkkbBs6MFFP5Wz1iBGM35wqCgQiq7RR8mFm7HZqPFCFchVV2.png)\n\nLet me give an instance. I was going out yesterday, and I saw a boy crying so hard. A lady was asking the mother what happened to the boy. And the woman responded that the boy is hungry; he wants to eat bread, but he couldn't afford it at the moment. I can hear this clearly because we were in the same place. \n\nI was able to place an order for what I needed to buy. And I remembered that, if this little boy can be this hungry and we are neighbors, my responsibility is to make sure I look after my neighbor's. I immediately bought two pieces of bread and handed them over to the boy. Guess what? He stopped crying immediately, the woman was also happy, and I was also happy I came at the right time.\n\nHere is my point: if we all could be there to some extent for people, we would have fewer people suffering. I strongly believe food is very important. Some people are so wicked, and they started treating people so badly. At some point, I didn't blame them. I blame their parents, who do not teach and show their children how to love their neighbors.\n\nCharity truly begins at home; know your responsibilities as a human, and then everything will fall back to its place.\n\nThis is my entry to #Inleoprompt for July.\n \n**<sup><sub>Images designed using canva</sup></sub>**\n</div>\n\nPosted Using [InLeo Alpha](https://inleo.io/@moremoney28/charity-in-my-opinion-it-begins-at-home-lbv)",

Many persons have misinterpreted it today, by coining different meaning for themselves.  He said that charity should begin at home but should not end there but should be extended to the rest of the world. \n\nThe world can be a better place if we all decide to take responsibility first to ourselves then extend the to the world, if you have to show love to people it is important that you start by showing love first to yourselves before reaching out to the other.\n\nThis is living life by example, the change that you intend to bring to the world or your immediate environment, will have to start with you, the knowledge that you want to pass to another must have been your experience or what you or what you have tried yourself.\n\nCharity is a show of love or care to someone or a set of persons, but the first person what will first experience that show of love will be from within, you will need to have it to be able to give out to another. \nIt is not possible to be known by people afar off, when people living with you don’t know you, whatever you have to give to people far off, you must have started first with people living with you, your true identity is more known to people who lives with you more than strangers. \n\nAll your true good and amazing attributes, must begin from home, whatever you are known for, didn’t start outside, it began from home, but if you see things coming in from outside that was never seen at home, then there is something wrong, meaning that there had been some manipulations that resulted in the fake result but true character should and will come from home, Yes it will start from home but must not end there, it will be extended to the global family.\n\nEverything you will and can do tomorrow, is dependent on the foundation that was laid at the beginning, if the foundation has fault, then the entire system will be faulty, this is applicable in all area of life.  Marriage, academic, business and religion.  There must be a good start or a good foundation to be able to strive through the odds in the phases of life. The metaphorical saying implies that our show of love will start from within and then will reach out to the world.\n\nThanks for the privilege to share in the #julyinleo  initiative @emylight.\n\n\nPosted Using [InLeo Alpha](https://inleo.io/@emylight/charity-begins-at-home-let-the-change-begin-with-you-2v1)",
