{"content":"Hello everyone, I hope you are doing very well today and that your day is going very well too.\n https://img.inleo.io/DQmeSBPW53s9FWAhE75bhn2F88p78jeivNDCJhiDbz4QNGS/figures-1929874_1280.webp \n\n[Image](https://pixabay.com/illustrations/characters-people-silhouettes-peace-1929874/)\n\n\n\nHarmonious living is being where others coexist in a peaceful and balanced manner without having to disrespect any other person.\n\nNobody can stay alone in this world, so for you to stay with other people, you need to learn harmonious living.\n\nMutual respect must exist if people are to coexist. They have to learn how to respect others' opinions.\n\nTo respect another person or stay with them in peace, one has to be at peace with himself.\n\n\n\n\nHere are some of the ways you can practice harmonious living in society:\n\n\n\n\nEmpathy and Understanding: To coexist with others, you need to put your legs in their shoes and make sure that you treat them the way you would want them to treat you too.\n\nIf you want people to understand you, then you also need to understand them.\n\n\n\n\nRespect Diversity: You need to respect other people's opinions, cultural beliefs, race, and religion and embrace them too.\n\nYou don't have to make them feel worse or probably want to convince them to do things the way you do. Make them feel better and more welcomed; do not scare people away.\n\nAnother is that you should always accept people for their character and correct them with love so as not to push them away.\n\n\n\n\nCommunication: If you want to coexist with people in a harmonious way, you need to listen well, speak clearly, and also act respectfully.\n\nNobody likes feeling bad, so do not make other people feel bad because of how you act, talk, or don't listen to them.\n\n\n\n\nHave an Open Mind: Be ready to embrace new ideas, new beliefs, new perspectives, etc.\n\nYou never know if those new things are correct or not, but if you just want to be correct at all times, people may not really like you, and you may not also live in peace with them.\n\n\n\n\nBe Kind: If you want to be liked, then like other people. No one will like a person who doesn't like other people. Show some kindness to people, help them, and make them happy.\n\n\n\n\nForgive: I would always say to forgive in advance, and in doing this, you need to know that people will hurt you mistakenly or purposefully, but in all, learn how to forgive people.\n\n\n\n\nGratefulness: Learn how to appreciate people for what they do for you.\n\nNo matter how small the favor is, let them know how special that favor is to you.\n\n\n\n\nDo not engage in violence. There are people that cannot stay without fighting, and if there is a fight going on somewhere, they will have to be there to make sure that they make the fight worse.\n\nAlways learn to be responsible and accountable for something; don't say \"I don't know\" to every question that you are asked, because it will show that you are not responsible at all.\n\nDon't gossip or talk down on anyone who has made a mistake; try to encourage people and help them stand up and not fall.\n\n\n\n\nPosted Using [InLeo Alpha](https://inleo.io/@somuchgrace/tips-for-a-peaceful-coexistence--g14)"}
