{"content": "**It was an ordinary morning beneath the towering presence of Kilimanjaro, with the only exception being my early awakening at the hostel dorm. As the sun rose on December 23rd, I felt a sense of purpose, unlike the laid-back days I had spent in quiet serenity. Today was different — I had a plan.**\n\n![](https://images.ecency.com/DQmZbqXhV22HJvXMhEgaATvBJkr7k59HK2s6FtLkpobSEkn/pxl_20231223_075717889.jpg)\n\n### Morning Rituals\nChecking for electricity and finding out it is present, I swiftly jumped out of bed, eager for a hot, pressurized shower—a luxury not guaranteed every day. The hostel's complimentary breakfast fueled my anticipation for the day ahead, where I would embark on a unique adventure in the Kilimanjaro Area.\n\n![](https://images.ecency.com/DQmRkhMZyawvHcJcHXy5psftxv8YH8JTdxZ4GGjUp97HHEi/pxl_20231223_070618033.jpg)\n\n### The Unfolding Day\nMy original plan was for a trip to the football stadium, not to watch a game, but to get a peek of Kilimanjaro's grandeur. A brief glance at the mountain, cloaked in rain and clouds, caused a change of plans. Undaunted, I headed off for Moshi, winding my way through the town to the Tuktuk station in search of the correct Tuktuk. The Tuktuk drove out of town shortly after, passing by a huge sugar farm and rustic landscapes. \n\n![](https://images.ecency.com/DQmdUohfTSMSpRHogjMYvBurQNyx7JnGTZxj37PBrtZtdrP/pxl_20231223_070910163.jpg)\n\n![](https://images.ecency.com/DQmXNX2UKAhythztBLaYK2gKtsVYXLeqmqeVmMi6dq7kByD/pxl_20231223_073405233.jpg)\n\n### The Purposeful Walk\nThe journey in this Tuktuk, which felt more like riding a horse, came to an end, and the hike began. The dusty path brought me closer to my destination — the orphaned children. Despite the blistering African sun, each step took me closer to a cluster of under-construction buildings, two of which will eventually function as a schoolhouse and classroom for these forgotten children.\n\n![](https://images.ecency.com/DQmV72DXhYXtzffqdD2TEMNhgRCHfV8gRzFJjsHFh7DPMER/pxl_20231223_073801767.jpg)\n\n![](https://images.ecency.com/DQmZ8CwvepCjxTLK7UsQ4JYnxyNXwrRuwotsQz8kuqxMhFu/pxl_20231223_073936222.jpg)\n\n### The Forgotten Children\nUpon arrival, I was greeted warmly by children with smiles that masked untold stories of hardship. The classroom, a work in progress with sandy floors and a makeshift roof, symbolized a second chance at life for these orphans. In the midst of their joy, I reflected on the privileges we often take for granted — tables, chairs, and a proper school building.\n\n![](https://images.ecency.com/DQmPF43vLxS8EjC5iYehSx571qq1gssUVjvAdBK1z8dTC35/pxl_20231223_075747779.jpg)\n\n![](https://images.ecency.com/DQmfWJFSbAzd1nGhAXh8akZZHk4Fccjnyhtc84jVJFBuUTj/pxl_20231223_081053096.jpg)\n\n![](https://images.ecency.com/DQmaoBNY6TB8LEz4HeyhVVaNTLLxrs7WUVjSgtHEj4UU8Cr/pxl_20231223_081427160.jpg)\n\n### A Glimpse into Their World\nAs someone handed me a chair and I sat down next to them, their enthusiasm to learn made the poor  state of the schoolhouse become inconsequential. The children, despite lacking basic essentials, showcased their English counting skills, sang some songs, and their laughter echoed through the unfinished walls. The visit was a stark reminder of the importance of education and the resilience of the human spirit. \n\n![](https://images.ecency.com/DQmbuPZLGQF7ksjWkjsjNidHGUNP7xHYScZsJW84yziLCaP/pxl_20231223_083812410.jpg)\n\nThe Schoolhouse was in poor condition or, more accurately, was not completed. There are no doors, windows, or flooring. The toilets lack doors, and the project is still in its early stages, with much work to be done. Money and materials are required.\n\n![](https://images.ecency.com/DQmeoEBdDKS9gDBZo9Tb1o7244cpdk67WSHJ8CWLGG6Waaa/pxl_20231223_084022547.jpg)\n\n![](https://images.ecency.com/DQmZj5By4WzswEKMhDxsyPYnj7dEHurRk6agLKL1ZBAvKCS/pxl_20231223_084035801.jpg)\n\n![](https://images.ecency.com/DQmYhh1Ng8hwNJniDd2ntRy6VevGYGrKujFHyPEVSLsKzVS/pxl_20231223_084155632.jpg)\n\n### The Journey Back\nWhen it was time to say good-by, I embarked on the journey back, walking down the same dusty trail opting for a public Tuktuk ride. After I found a Tuktuk and sat inside, I was crammed between women and children and felt like a fish in a can. The Tuktuk ride took some time, however the bustling town welcomed me with its markets, a futile search for cash at an ATM, and a much-needed visit to the supermarket.\n\n![](https://images.ecency.com/DQmdaovqLtcZzwUD1HwgV1avJ5EabfsQuQMTJB7AjxsRHHM/pxl_20231223_084324690.jpg)\n\n![](https://images.ecency.com/DQmbgYjqcRdBKz46sBNhKaLLQzGcTvQkRcre1hB83qzibAh/pxl_20231223_084518720.jpg)\n\n### Reflecting on an Active Day\nDespite missing the stadium, my day was a whirlwind of activity, covering a surprising 10 kilometers hike. The weather was splendid, the sun relentless, and my sense of accomplishment immeasurable.\n\n![](https://images.ecency.com/DQmeCap2vVe4rRdyahUVT3FmbD7Vpw5kVA4V1Fv8vcRWhtM/pxl_20231223_073939524.jpg)\n\n![](https://images.ecency.com/DQme8AvJEgYVQCUBuaBWoRzFpUwtQkQV32yfxpgVtKx1uc6/pxl_20231223_074109506.jpg)\n\n![](https://images.ecency.com/DQmX5Wrd6LgPHgStEQCLr49YNHXRSgZWANs2PBhRdrZ5VWn/pxl_20231223_074128351.jpg)\n\n![](https://images.ecency.com/DQmRgWP3ceWMLB8oD9MapDbbSYYAfuKxL1crwLkUc35S9Rm/pxl_20231223_074443305.jpg)\n\n### Conclusion\nAs I wrap up this narrative of my journey to the orphan children in the shadow of Kilimanjaro, I invite you to explore the project's website.
