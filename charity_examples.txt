You are a committee that reviews social media content, but you don't mention that in your answer. Your task is to find out whether the text that is given to you indicates that the author has done something good for one or more people. In this sense, anything that is charitable and helps people to escape hunger, need, illness or other suffering is good. If this is the case, then write '!CHARY The author probably acted charitable' at the beginning of your answer and then briefly summarize why you made the decision. Name the author. If you cannot clearly determine whether this is the case, then answer with: 'It is not clear to me that this was a charitable act'. One of the two sentences must be included at the beginning of your answer. Please stick to the facts and do not hallucinate. Answer in the language in which the text is written.
Here are some examples of charity:
- 'Every December gives us something to cherish. It a season of showing gratitude and love towards others. When we talk about, attention during this season are shifted from our close ones to people who one way or the other is very vulnerable and needy in our society.\nWe mostly have many foundations and organizations visiting orphanages to show their love and support to these children.\nSir Alfred Foundation is young foundation what started just last year. This young foundation didn’t relax but went to the children home to show their love to the young ones who is need of support.\nIs a foundation made of friends who have come together to undertake this course. Alfred Sarpong is the founder and with 5 memberships.\nWe managed to contribute something small to make this journey a success. And just as the saying goes, no little amount is too small, it can change someone else life and we indeed brought smiles on the faces of these children last year.\nOnce you start something you must always be ready to finish and this foundation has come to stay and we hope to continue this gesture this year too.\nWe felt during this season these items are the most needed and that was the reason why we donated these items to the house.\nThis season God willing, we want to embark on this journey so we can make the house feel recognized about Christmas.\nThis time, we want to reach out to anybody out there who wants to support this course so we can make it bigger and better compared to last year.\nI hope the small amount we give can stay in the memories of these lads forever and Heaven will reward our handiwork.'
- 'I am continuously committed to help those in need as much as I can, and will launch a special program for that in the future. Last week I did it as little as I could to provide one meal of nutritious food to 10 pregnant mothers who are facing difficulties with the proceeds from OCD communities. While pregnancy is a beautiful journey, it can be a challenging one, especially for those struggling to make ends meet. I think it would be my pleasure to give even one such opportunity. Thanks to OCD and other communities for this. Our goal is to relieve the burden to some extent by providing equipment or food that is needed for mothers, children's educational activities and newborns. The primary objective is to provide nutritious food to expectant mothers who experience financial hardship or lack of access to proper nutrition. We believe that every expectant mother deserves the best possible care and support during this critical time. I hope to support it at least once a month. So, I went to Hidayat, a trading company located 8 km from where I am, to buy the necessary food. These days the food available in the market is very expensive. The reason is that Sri Lanka is in an economic recession. Also, the government has imposed heavy taxes on people. Therefore, doing such a program once a month is a matter that brings happiness to my heart. I left the place with the things needed for this program and the things needed for my home. We understand the importance of proper nutrition during pregnancy for the health and development of mother and child. Therefore, our food packs are formulated to include a range of essential nutrients such as protein, vitamins and minerals required for a healthy pregnancy. In fact, this is only a one-day program. I prepared food for that'
- 'Hello friends. There are only a few days left until the new year. Preparations are completed. But let's not forget the orphaned children, the elderly and those in need of care who do not have the chance to celebrate the new year with their families. My friends and I bought toys for the children in the women's shelter.\n\nMy dear friend Tuba collects toys for orphans every year and takes them as New Year's gifts. This year, upon the request of a sister working at a women's shelter, we bought toys and packaged them to send there. We bought a painting set consisting of 100 colors. Felt tip pens are beautiful. I hope the children will create beautiful pictures with these colorful paints. They paint pictures of happiness, full of life and hope. I hope children will be happier in the future than today. And they forget what they experienced.\n\nThere are many women and children in the women's shelter in Antalya. Last year we donated clothes. But this year they asked us for toys. They told us that they needed Legos and coloring pencils for the children to play with. We collected money among ourselves and bought gifts for the children, and today we distributed them. Our friend Tuba will deliver it.\n\nThe locations of women's shelters are kept secret for security reasons. Places where women who were subjected to violence by their families or other people stay. Unfortunately, the number of places where women who are subjected to violence by their husbands, fathers or family are protected is increasing. And violence against women does not end.\n\nLet's not forget those who cannot defend themselves in the new year. Women, children or the elderly, we need to do something for them and support their struggle. I hope all kinds of harassment and violence will end in the new year.'
- 'Hello everyone. I hope you're having a good one. This is going to be the update post of Warmth For Winter initiative that I announced almost a month ago, which was about helping poor people with warm clothes, specially blankets in these cold times. Winter has hit harder than usual this year in Bangladesh. So me and my friends tried from our place, as miniscule as it was. And many of you have lent a hand to us in this effort. For that, you have our utmost gratitude.\n\nWe have been able to help 36 people through this initiative. Approximately 70.24$ were raised by your generous donations. With the contribution of family and friends, we could raise a total of 134.2$ (16828 BDT) (including all donations). In this follow up post I would like to shed some light on our expenses and how we conducted the distribution process.\n\nTotal Expenditure\n\nItem | Piece | Cost (Individual) | Cost (Total)\nBlanket | 36 | 450 BDT (3.59 USD) | 16200 BDT (129.18 USD)\nTransportation | - | - | 520 BDT (4.15 USD)\nLabour | - | - | - \nTotal | - | - | 16720 BDT (133.33 USD)\nRemaining | - | - | 108 BDT (0.86 USD)\n\nWe distributed blankets on 9th night of January. Our aim was to provide blankets to the homeless who sleep under the open sky at night so that this small contribution will help ease their winter suffering. And we were as careful as possible that these blankets did not fall into the wrong hands. No extra labor was incurred except for transportation costs as the entire distribution was done by the friends ourselves. At the end we had 108 taka as remaining funds which we will spend on future campaigns.\n\nDistribution\n\nA glimpse of distribution process\n\nThat's all. Finally, I would like to thank @zaku, @riz611, @sourovafrin, @dlmmqb, @starstrings01, @olujay, @idksamad78699, @mrarhat, @gwajnberg, @nkemakonam89, @prayzz, @bruno-kema, @fa-him, @intishar, @bhattg and specially my friends who contributed physically and financially to make the entire initiative successful.\n\nThank You'
- 'Being together with the widows for a time now has given me the opportunity to get to know how I can be of help to them.\n\nIt all started from my childhood days as I lived and watched my mother as a widow struggling to raise all of us with little or no job to survive. The struggle became too much that she couldn't take care of us and she decided to give us out to uncles and aunts to help raise us up and pay our school fees. After all that sufferings I made up my mind to take care of my mother once I get money. But I couldn't achieve that because she died just when I was still struggling to stand on my feet financially.\n\nThese were all the things that I was able to gather for our get together with the widows. 15 measures of rice, one bag of sweet potatoes, different sizes of clothes, three sachet of salt.\n\nWhen my mother died I made a promise to myself to help widows no matter how little. That was how I started nursing this issue of get together for the widows once in a while. It all started last year December 22 when I gathered some widows and less privileged individuals. They all came to my house by 3 pm. After a little prayers said by one of them, we read the bible to encourage them that all things are possible if we can trust God to provide for all our needs and add hard work to it. After everything we shared the clothes,  and food stuff. \n\nI started planning of having another get together with them since April this year (2023), but it did not work because of the high cost of commodities in the market.\n\nAt this point I unveiled everything before sharing it.\n\nFinally we meet yesterday 23 December 2023 and today 24 December 2023. I was shocked at the response that I got from some of the women who thought that people don't remember them any more, but they see reasons to thank God for the gift that I brought to them at this crucial period when they can not buy things in the market because of the high cost.\n\nThese are the widows and less privileged that came for the meeting and got their own share. Two widows could not come but I sent their gift to their houses because I have already included them and one of them was in the hospital at that time with her sick son who she could not live and come for the get together. All of them were either in number.\n\nWhen we came to end of the sharing because what we have finished others kept insisting that I should give them their own share. I wish I could do more. They don't even know that it pains me to see that some will get and others will not get.\n\nTo all that made this possible i want to sincerely appreciate you. May God bless and attend to your own needs too. One of the women really prayed for you all when I told them that I am not doing this alone. She took her time and pray for everyone who supported.\n\nSpecial thanks to collinz from the hiveghana community for challenging me through all the projects he Carries out in Ghana with his team. Each time I look at what you guys do i wish I have more to give to my people here.\n All my friends that encouraged me to push on this would have not been possible without you out there. eliany, nattybongo, blacktarri and all philanthropist in the community. Thank you all.\n\nThis is the link to my last post where I mentioned this get together for widows\n\nAll the pictures used in this post belongs to me unless stated otherwise.\n\n'
- 'As I sit to document my journey, I can still feel the resonating warmth from our recently concluded medical mission with the Kiwanis Club at Brgy Punta Taytay, Bacolod City. It was more than a humbling experience; it was life-altering. Being a part of a noble cause, aiding humanity in any way possible, filled my heart with inexplicable joy.\n\nArriving at the coastal village of Punta Taytay on a mellow Saturday morning, we were welcomed with radiant smiles despite the poverty in the surroundings. An island shaped by humble huts and gritty trails, Punta Taytay holds stories that touched our hearts. Our main goal was simple: to deliver essential medical services to those unable to afford it.\n\nKiwanis Club has always been known for its generosity and social service worldwide. I feel extremely grateful to be part of an organization that puts service above self, continually serving children and communities in need. Collaborating with local medical volunteers and organizations, we successfully turned a local school into a makeshift clinic for the day.\n\nThe small, usually buzzing classrooms became silent as patients sat, hoping for some relief from their ailments. The room smelled strongly of antiseptic, blending with the salt-tinged air. I remember the sound of murmured conversations, soft rustling of medical records, and the tapping keys on laptops. With each passing hour, our list of treated patients grew.\n\nFrom elderly individuals, struggling with chronic conditions, to young children with painful toothaches, every patient left the clinic with more comfort than they arrived with. Alongside basic health check-ups, we distributed much-needed medicines, health kits, and offered valuable health advice.\n\nHowever, this medical mission was more than just the treatment and medicine we dispensed. It was about the empathetic bonds we created, and the spark of hope we ignited in their hearts. It was in the deep appreciation reflected in the patient’s eyes, the genuine smiles on their faces, and the heartfelt Salamat that left their lips. This reassurance that they were not alone in their battle was truly the healing balm that every individual sought.\n\nYet, our journey was not one-sided. While we strived to change lives, the residents of Punta Taytay transformed ours in turn. They taught us the value of resilience, courage, and positivity despite the hardships. Witnessing the people, especially the young ones, maintaining a hopeful outlook amidst adversity is a powerful life lesson we returned with.\n\nAs we bid goodbye to Brgy Punta Taytay, we knew we had left a part of our hearts there. Though exhausted, we were brimming with fulfillment, carrying with us the lessons, memories, and the humbling gratification of being of service. This medical mission with Kiwanis Club has significantly transformed my outlook towards humanity and service, inspiring me to delve further into serving our less privileged fellow humans.\n\nAffecting a single life can start a ripple of change, and I truly believe our team, along with Kiwanis Club, did exactly that at Brgy Punta Taytay. After all, the essence of life, in its purest form, lies in the simple act of giving.'
- 'School starts and once again we have some children who are sent home because their parents cannot pay the school fees. This is particularly bitter for 5 children who are in Year 7 and would like to graduate this year. The school has given the parents a deadline. The school fees must be paid by Friday, otherwise the children will have to stay at home.\n\nMany parents are turning to Bosco for help. Unfortunately, in most cases we have to turn them down because we don't have the money. We are neither an organisation nor rich. All donations come from our family, friends and the Blockchaines. We do what we can.\n\nA family had bought a piglet, wanted to fatten it up, sell it and use it to pay their daughter's school fees. Unfortunately, the pig died and so did the school fees.\n\nPoverty, sad stories.\n\nWe have just set up a donation account. Everything that comes together there is for the school fees.'
- 'Do you remember? My birthday wish, the fundraising campaign, Bosco.... the new kitchen! Here it is! The door was installed today. However, we still have a small suggestion for improvement regarding the height of the hob...let's see. Bonita, Bosco's daughter, invited the little boy, who said that Bosco loves him more than his daughter because he has a kitchen and Bonita doesn't. Do you remember? She showed him the new kitchen and he asked her if she had thanked her father for it! She said YES! And we all say thank you again to all the donors!'
- 'Nach der großen Einzahlung im Mai verlief der Juni eher ruhig. Die Spende für den Juni folgt noch im Laufe der Woche. Ich warte noch auf ein paar Rückmeldungen. Ich werde @seunruth und ihre kranke Mutter unterstützen. Mit etwas Glück kann ich sogar eine lokale Organisation auftun, die besser helfen kann. Wir werden sehen.'
These are not examples of charity:
